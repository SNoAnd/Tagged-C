\section{Introduction}

In this paper we introduce a novel compartmentalization scheme that distinguishes between memory
that is local to compartments, and memory shared between them by memory-safe pointers. Our Tagged
C implementation places fewer requirements on the underlying tagged hardware that similar systems
from the literature. We describe the specification of the policy in terms of an abstract machine
that gives definition to many memory undefined-behaviors if they are internal to a compartment,
allowing it to describe the behavior of the system in the presence of UB more precisely. We then prove
that Tagged C, running our compartmentalization policy, preserves all properties of the abstract
machine.

\subsection{Motivating Example}

Consider a program for firing missiles that listens on standard input for a password,
checks it against the master password in its own memory, and reports whether it was correct.
If correct, it launches missiles with a system call. It also logs that it recieved an attempted
launch before checking, using an off-the-shelf logging library.

Should the logging library have a vulnerability, it might be used to undermine the security
of the whole system. The harm that it can do is not obvious, assuming the basic restriction that
it cannot call {\tt \_\_sys\_fire\_missiles} directly, but in a memory unsafe setting it could
easily overwrite {\tt master\_pwd} to make it match the supplied password, or leak its value to
be used in a future attempt.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
#def LEN 1 // parameterize pwd length
char* master_pwd;

void listen() {
  char pwd[LEN];
  while (1) {
    gets(pwd);
    // call external log library 
    log("launch attempt");
    if (check_pwd(pwd)) {
      __sys_fire_missiles();
    }
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
void init() {
  master_pwd = malloc(sizeof(int)*LEN);
  for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i++) {
    master_pwd[i] = '0';
  }
}

int check_pwd(int* pwd) {
  for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i++) {
    if (pwd[i] != master_pwd[i])
      return 0; // bad password
  }
  return 1; // report success
}
\end{verbatim}
  \end{minipage}

\caption{Example Password Checker}

\end{figure}

One approach to making the system secure is to compartmentalize it. All of the above code
is gathered in one unit, which we will call \(A\), and kept separate from the logging library,
which belongs to its own compartment, \(B\). We might further keep the standard library in yet
another compartment, \(C\). The compartments' memories are kept disjoint, except that {\tt gets}
must take a pointer to an array that will be accessible to both \(A\) and \(C\).
The special {\tt \_\_sys\_fire\_missiles} function is modeled as an external call,
outside of both compartments.

How do we know when this compartmentalization is successful? For this specific program,
we could try to prove that it satisfies a particular {\em property} describing its dynamic behavior.
In English, that property would be, ``I only fire the missiles after recieving the valid password.''
But we can't prove that without first getting it into a more rigorous form. For that, we
need a {\em trace semantics} that provides a simple description of how compartments talk to
one another in a given execution. This semantics needs enable reasoning about program behavior
in the presence of shared memory.

Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item A novel compartmentalization policy for Tagged C that supports cross-compartment
  sharing with fewer constraints on available tags than similar systems from the literature.
\item A formal model of C compartmentalization in the form of an abstract machine that
  supports sharing between compartments while keeping their memories isolated by construction.
\item A proof that the compartmentalization policy is safe with respect to the abstract semantics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Work}

There are many compartmentalization mechanisms in the literature, and several formal
characterizations of compartmentalized systems.

Abate et al. \cite{Abate18:GoodComponentsBad} characterize compartmentalization in the
presence of undefined behavior, treating UB as equivalent to compromise by an adversary.
Their model does not support shared memory, and their policy places strong constraints on potential
hardware implementations: they assume linear tags, which are unlikely to appear
in realistic implementations.

Building on their work, El-Korashy et al. \cite{ElKorashy22:SecurePtrs} present a compartmentalization
scheme that does support shared memory. They use a much more restrictive specification
than Abate et al.: their source language is fully memory-safe and has no UB. Their
focus is on showing that they can enforce their compartmentalized calling convention
in a memory safe setting. They are not focused on the underlying enforcement hardware,
but we can assume that any hardware implementation would need to be of similar complexity
to others capable of enforcing full memory-safety, e.g. Acevedo de Amorim et al.
\cite{AdA18:MeaningMemorySafety}. 

Thibault et al. \cite{} go deeper into their prove effort: they prove safe compilation of a
compartmentalized version of CompCert C down to a compartmentalized assembly language.
In the process they give up sharing. Their treatment of UB is similar to Abate et al.,
but they add new UB in the form of violations of the compartment interfaces.

Compared to these works in total, our model supports cross-compartment sharing while placing
fewer constraints on the hardware than El-Korashy et al. We also support a full C setting,
though instead of a full compilation chain we attach our policy directly to the Tagged C
source semantics. Our abstract machine is also more precise about its treatment of UB than
the others: it gives definition to some UB, and so can be used to reason about the behavior
of compartments that contain it but still display consistent internal behavior.

\section{Abstract Sharing Semantics}

In the example above, we discussed the security of a compartmentalized
system in terms of which compartments have recieved pointers to which memory.
We define a C semantics that builds this kind of reasoning into the memory model.
The model aims to fulfill a few key criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compartments are obviously and intuitively isolated from one another
  by construction
\item It is suitable for hardware enforcement without placing intensive constraints
  on the target
\item Inter-compartment interactions via shared memory are possible
\item Compartments can only access shared memory if they have first obtained a
  valid pointer to it, consistent with the C standard and ``capability reasoning''
\end{itemize}

We don't necessarily care that compartments' internal behavior
conforms to the C standard. In fact our model explicitly gives compartments
a concrete view of memory, giving definition to code that would be undefined behavior
in the standard, such as described in Memarian et al. \cite{Memarian19:ExploringCSemantics}.

Figure \ref{ch5:fig:memmod} defines the memory model that we use in our abstract machine.
We separate the world into compartments, ranged over by \(C\), each with its own distinct
concrete memory. A concrete memory \(m\) partially maps machine
integer (\(\mathit{int}\)) addresses to values with a basic axiomatization given in
Figure \ref{ch5:subfig:rwstep}. One memory of this kind is assigned to each compartment, and
each shared object is allocated in its own separate concrete memory.

  \caption{Reads and Writes}
  \label{ch5:subfig:rwstep}
\end{figure}

Memories are kept totally separate, fulfilling our first requirement:
compartments' local memories are definitely never accessible to other compartments.
Shared memories are only accessible via valid pointers.

Pointers into local and shared memories are distinguished from one another by construction.
A pointer value consists of a pair: a region ranged over by \(r\) drawn from the set
\(\mathcal{R}\) that determines which memory it accesses, and a machine integer address representing
its concrete position. A region is either \(\mathbf{L}(C)\), for local pointers into
the compartment \(C\), or \(\mathbf{S}(id,\mathit{base})\), where \(id\) is an
abstract identifier and \(\mathit{base}\) is a machine integer. Regions are identified
in general by their compartment identifiers or abstract identifiers, collectively
the set \(R \subseteq \mathcal{C} + \mathit{ident}\). An environment \(e\) maps variable names to
their regions and position. A ``super-memory'' \(M\)
is a record containing a map from region identities to memories, \(ms\),
and lists of allocated regions for both stack and heap, \(stk\) and \(heap\).

\(M.heap\) and \(M.stk\) are lists of triples \((r, a_1, a_2)\) representing
the allocated regions of the heap and stack, respectively.
Once an object is allocated within a region, reads and writes are guaranteed to succeed
within its bounds in that region's memory. Reads and writes to unallocated regions may
failstop, but if they do not the behave consistently with the axioms in Figure \ref{ch5:subfig:rwstep}.
The allocation and free operations for both stack and heap act on the super-memory
as axiomatized in Figure \ref{ch5:subfig:alstep}.

This axiomatization serves to abstract away concrete details about memory layout
that may be specific to a given compiler-allocator-hardware combination. We can
understand any particular instance of \(\mathcal{M}\) as an oracle that divines where
the target system will place each allocation and, with knowledge of the full layout of
memory, determines what happens in the event of an out-of-bounds read or write.

  \label{ch5:subfig:alstep}
\end{figure}


Using a flat memory model in each region gives two benefits. First, it is generally
less expensive to enforce, and therefore can be implemented on tagged hardware that is more
restrictive. Second, it allows the abstract machine to reason about how programs with some
forms of memory UB will behave after compilation, given a particular compiler and allocator.

\paragraph{Allocation}

The abstract operations \(\mathit{heap\_alloc}\) and \(\mathit{stk\_alloc}\)
yield addresses at which they locate a newly allocated object, either within a
compartment's local region or in its own isolated region. In the latter case,
the address provided becomes the base tracked by that region's pointers.
Since the \(\mathit{*\_alloc}\) operations are parameterized by the identity of
the region they are allocating within, they are allowed to make decisions based on that
information, such as clumping compartment-local allocations together to 
protect them using a page-table-based enforcement mechanism.
This is a nondeterministic semantics, but given any particular instantiation of
the oracle, the semantics becomes deterministic.

Allocations are guaranteed to be disjoint from any prior allocations in the
same region. (In fact, when targeting a system with a single address space, we further restrict
them to be disjoint across all bases.) Addresses in allocated regions are guaranteed
successful loads and stores, and once an unallocated address has been successfully accessed
it will behave consistently until new memory is allocated anywhere in the system,
at which point all unallocated memory again becomes unpredictable.

The \(\mathit{perturb}\) operation similarly represents the possibility of compiler-generated
code using unallocated memory and therefore changing its value or rendering it inaccessible.
The only facts that are maintained over a call to perturb are those involving addresses in
allocated regions. Perturb happens during every function call and return, because the compiler
needs to be free to reallocate memory during those operations, but it may happen at other
points in the semantics as well.

\paragraph{Arithmetic and Integer-Pointer Casts}

Most arithmetic operations are typical of C. The interesting operations are those
involving integers that have been cast from pointers. We give concrete definitions
to all such operations based on their address. As shown in Figure \ref{ch5:fig:arith}, if they
involve only a single former pointer, the result will also be a pointer into the
same memory; otherwise the result is a plain integer. If the former pointer is cast
back to a pointer type, it retains its value and is once again a valid pointer.
Otherwise, if an integer value is cast to a pointer, the result is always a local
pointer to the active compartment.

  \label{ch5:fig:arith}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Calls and Returns}

There are two interesting details of the call and return semantics:
they allocate and deallocate memory, and they can cross compartment boundaries.
In the first case, we need to pay attention to which stack-allocated
objects are to be shared. This can again be done using escape analysis:
objects whose references never escape, can be allocated locally. Objects whose
references escape to another compartment must be allocated as shared.
Those that escape to another function in the same compartment can be treated
in either way; if they are allocated locally but are later passed outside the
compartment, the system will failstop at that later point
(see Section \ref{ch5:sec:interfaces}).

We assume that each local variable comes pre-annotated with how it should
be allocated, with a simple flag \(\mathbf{L}\) or \(\mathbf{S}\), so that
a function signature is a list of tuples \((id,\mathbf{L} \mid \mathbf{S},sz)\).
(Aside: there is a case to be made we should just allocate all stack objects locally
barring some critical use case for share them. Doing so would simplify the model here.)

The allocation and deallocation of stack memory is shown in the step rules in
Section \ref{ch5:fig:callret}. In the full semantics, calls and returns step through
intermediate states, written \(\mathit{CALL}\) and \(\mathit{RET}\). During the
step from the intermediate callstate into the function code proper, the semantics
looks up the function being called and allocates its local variables before beginning
to execute its statement. And during the step from the {\tt return} statement into
the intermediate returnstate, the semantics likewise deallocates every variable it had
previously allocated.

\paragraph{Cross-compartment interfaces}
\label{ch5:sec:interfaces}

In this system, each function is assigned to a compartment. We write the static mapping
from function identifiers \(\mathtt{f}\) to compartments \(\mathit{comp}(\mathtt{f})\).
Each compartment has an interface that is the subset of its functions that are publicly
accessible. We write that a function \(\mathtt{f}\) is public in \(C\) as
\(\mathit{pub}(\mathtt{f},C)\).

At any given time, the compartment that contains the currently active function is
considered the active compartment. It is illegal to call a private function in an
inactive compartment. Public functions may not receive \(L(\dots)\)-region pointer arguments.
Private functions may take either kind of pointer as argument. \(L(\dots)\) pointers
may also not be stored to shared memory regions. This guarantees that there can be no
confusion between shared pointers and a compartment's own local pointer that
escaped its control. Violations of a compartment interface exhibit failstop behavior.

As a consequence of these rules, a compartment that recieves a pointer as an argument
or loads it from shared memory may rely on it not aliasing with any local pointer.
It could recieve such a pointer that has been cast to an integer type, but this is
not a problem: if it casts it back to a pointer, the risks are the same as if it
cast any other integer to a pointer.

Local (stack allocated) variables and globals are statically designated as shared or
compartment-local. We write that \(\mathtt{x}\) is designated shared as \(\mathit{share}(\mathtt{x})\).
For heap allocated objects, it is the call-sites to malloc that are statically designated.

\section{Implementing Compartmentalization in Tagged C}

A Tagged C policy defines three distinct types of tags: value tags 
drawn from set \(\tau_V\), control tags drawn from \(\tau_C\), and location tags
from \(\tau_L\). It also requires a {\it policy state} type \(\sigma\).
It instantiates a set of {\it tag rules}, each of which parameterizes the behavior
of key {\it control points} in the semantics. Tag rules are written in a procedural style,
assigning tags to their outputs by name. The state \(s : \sigma\) can always be accessed
and assigned to.

In this policy, control tags represent compartments, with the special {\it PC tag}
tracking the active compartment. Value tags distinguish between pointers that are local
to each compartment, pointers to each shared object, function pointers
(and which compartment their targets belong to), and all other values.
Location tags mark addresses as being allocated to a particular compartment or shared object, or
else unallocated. The policy state is a counter that tracks the next allocation color.
These definitions are shown in Figure \ref{ch5:fig:policy}, with \(\mathit{comp}\) being a
static mapping from function identifiers to compartment identifiers.

We implement the division between regions using the LocalT and MallocT tag rules
(for stack and heap allocations, respectively). These rules tag the memory locations
of freshly allocated objects with \(\mathtt{L}(C)\) or \(\mathtt{S}(id)\) depending
on the sharing status of the variable being allocated or of the call to malloc.
In the latter case, \(a\) is a fresh shared region identifier.
They apply the same tag to the base pointer of the allocated object.
Once we have a color attached to a pointer, it is propagated along
with the pointer, including through any arithmetic operations provided that the other operand
is not tagged as a pointer.

On loads and stores, we compare the tag on the pointer to that of the memory location
being accessed. If they are local, we also compare them to the active compartment.
If the tags match, the load or store may proceed, else it failstops.

Finally the StoreT, ArgT, and RetT rules enforce the restriction on the escape of local pointers.
  
\section{Proving Correctness}

Our correctness proofs relate the abstract machine defined above to the Tagged C semantics,
instantiated with the policy above. Specifically we prove a bi-directional simulation between
them: for any step that the abstract machine might take in the execution of a program, there
is an equivalent step in the Tagged C instantiation, and vice versa. The backwards direction
is particularly important because it means that the Tagged C semantics do not permit any
behaviors that the abstract semantics forbid.

\section{Machine Constraints}

Now we consider the constraints that this system places on potential implementations.
In particular, in a tag-based enforcemen mechanism with a limited quantity of tags,
is this system realistic? In general it requires a unique tag per compartment,
as well as one for each shared allocation. In the extreme, consider a system along
the lines of ARM's MTE, which has four-bit tags. That could only enforce this
semantics for a very small program, or one with very little shared memory
(fewer than sixteen tags, so perhaps two-four compartments and around a dozen shared objects.)

On the other hand, this semantics is a reasonable goal under an enforcement mechanism
with even eight-bit tags (512 compartments and shared objects.) If we go up to sixteen
bits, we can support programs with thousands of shared objects.

That said, it only takes a minor adjustment for our abstract machine to be enforceable in even
the smallest of tag-spaces. Instead of separate dynamic blocks for each shared
object, we let the set of memory regions consist of the powerset of compartments,
each region corresponding to the set of compartments that have permission to access it.
We parameterize each instance of {\tt malloc}
with such a set, which will be the base of each pointer that it allocates. We write
the identifiers for these {\tt malloc} invocations \(\mathtt{malloc}_r\).
Then we replace the relevant definitions and step rules with those in
Figure \ref{ch5:fig:powerset}, with call and return steps changed similarly.

This version can be enforced with a number of tags equal to the number of different
sharing combinations present in the system---in the worst case this would be
exponential in the number of compartments, but in practice it can be tuned to be
arbitrarily small. (In extremis, all shared objects can be grouped together to run
on a machine with only two tags.) Sadly it strays from the C standard in its
temporal memory safety: under some circumstances a shared object can be accessed
by a compartment that it has not (yet) been shared with.

\sna{I could give a policy for this variant, too, but not sure it's important enough.}
