\begin{abstract}
Today's computing infrastructure is built atop layers of legacy C code, often
insecure, poorly understood, and/or difficult to maintain.
These foundations may be shored up with dynamic security enforcement.
% and potentially introduce regressions.
Tagged C is a C variant with a built-in {\em tag-based reference monitor}.
It can express a variety of dynamic security policies and enforce them with
compiler and/or hardware support.

Tagged C expresses security policies at the level familiar to C developers: that
of the C source code rather than the ISA. It is comprehensive in supporting different
approaches to security as well as more or less restrictive policies. We demonstrate
this range by providing examples of {\em memory safety}, {\em compartmentalization},
and {\em secure information flow} (SIF) policies. We also give a semantics and reference
interpreter for Tagged C.

\section{Introduction}
Many essential technologies rely on new and old C code. 
Operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX, BSD), databases (Oracle, sqlite3), the internet
(Apache, NGNIX, NetBSD, Cisco IOS), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the 
embedded devices that run our homes and hospitals are built in and on C \cite{Munoz:PoweredbyC}. 
%C is not a relic; more than a third of professional programmers report active developing
%in C today \cite{stackoverflow22:dev-survey}. \apt{That sentence seems off topic of ``essential technologies.''}
The safety of these essential technologies
depends on the security of their underlying C codebases. Insecurity might take the form of
undefined behavior such as memory errors (e.g. buffer overflows, heap leaks, double-free),
logic errors (e.g. sql injection, input-sanitization flaws), or
larger-scale architectural flaws (e.g. over-provisioning access rights).

[TODO: Fill out more, esp. with relevant cituations.] Although static
analyses can detect and mitigate many C insecurities, the last line of
defense against undetected or unfixable vulnerabilities is runtime
enforcement of {\em security policies} using a reference
monitor~\cite{Anderson72:PlanningStudy}. A large class of useful policies
can be specified as \emph{data-flow} constraints based on \emph{metadata tags},
which attach to the underlying data to carry information like type, provenance,
ownership, or security classification. The policy takes the form of a set of
rules that check and update the metadata during execution; if a rule violation is
encountered, the program failstops. The class of policies that can be implemented
in this way includes fine-grained memory safety, secure information flow,
and mandatory access control, all of which are important security requirements
from the literature.

Tag-based policies can be enforced either in software or---more promisingly---with the
aid of hardware extensions such as ARM MTE~\cite{arm-mte},
STAR~\cite{Gollapudi+23}, and
PIPE~\cite{Dhawan+15,Azevedo+16,Azevedo+15}.  PIPE (Processor
Interlocks for Policy Enforcement),\footnote{ Variants of PIPE have
also been called PUMP~\cite{Dhawan+14,Dhawan+15},
SDMP~\cite{Dover16,RoesslerD18}) or CoreGuard~\cite{Dover20}.}
which has been the specific motivator for our work, is particularly flexible: it supports
arbitrary software-defined flow rules over large (word-sized) tags with arbitrary structure,
which enables finer-grained policies and the composition of multiple policies together.
This flexibility is useful because security needs may differ radically between codebases,
and even within a codebase. A conservative, one-size-fits-all policy might be too strong,
causing failstops even during normal execution. Sensitive code might call for specialized
protection that doesn't apply elsewhere.


But PIPE policies can be difficult for a C engineer to write: their tags and rules
are defined in terms of individual machine instructions and ISA-level
concepts, and in practice are based on reverse engineering the behavior
of specific compilers. 
Moreover, some security policies can only be expressed in terms of high-level code
features that are not preserved at machine level, such as function
arguments, structured types, and structured control flow.

To address these problems, we introduce a \emph{source-level} specification framework called \emph{Tagged C},
which allows engineers to describe policies in terms of familiar C-level concepts, with tags attached to
C functions, variables and data values, and rules triggered at \emph{control points} that correspond to
significant execution events, such as function calls, expression evaluation, and pointer-based memory accesses. 
Control points resemble ``advice points'' in aspect-oriented programming, but narrowly
focused on the manipulation of tags.
In previous work, Chhak et al.~\cite{Chhak21:Tagine} outlined such a framework for a toy
source language and showed how high-level policies could be compiled to ISA-level policies and 
enforced using PIPE-like hardware.  We extend this approach to handle
the full, real C language, by giving a detailed design for the necessary control points and
showing how they are integrated into C's dynamic semantics. 
Although motivated by PIPE, Tagged C is not tied to any particular enforcement mechanism,
and indeed we currently implement it using a modified C interpreter rather than via compilation.
We validate the design of Tagged C by using it to specify a range of interesting security policies,
including compartmentalization, memory protection, and secure information flow.

%Importantly, a security policy can be modified without recompilation unless it is optimized as described in
%\cref{sec:optionals}.

Formally, Tagged C is defined as a variant C semantics that instruments ordinary execution with control points.
At each control point, a user-defined set of tag rules is consulted to propagate tags and potentially cause
execution to failstop. In the limiting case where no tag rules are defined, the semantics are similar to
those of ordinary C, except that the memory model is very concrete
  (pointers and integers are essentially the same thing).\apt{Maybe explain why here, or forward ref.}
  We build our semantics on top of the CompCert C semantics, which are formalized 
  as part of the CompCert verified compiler \cite{Leroy09:CompCert}. We provide a reference interpreter
  also based on that of CompCert, for use in prototyping and executing policies. Tag rules are written directly in Coq as Gallina
  functions.

\paragraph{Contributions}

In summary we offer the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item The design of a comprehensive set of {\em control points} at which the C language interfaces with a tag-based policy
\item Tagged C policies implementing (1) compartmentalization,
  (2) a realistic, permissive memory model from the literature (PVI),
  and (3) Secure Information Flow (SIF)
\item A full formal semantic definition for Tagged C, formalized in Coq, describing how the control points
  interact with programs
\item A Tagged C interpreter, implemented in Coq and extracted to Ocaml
\end{itemize}

[TODO: rework]
In the next section, we give a high-level introduction of metadata-tagging: how it works,
and how its use can improve security. Then in \cref{sec:semantics}, we briefly discuss the
language as a whole, before moving into policies in \cref{sec:policies}. Finally, in
\cref{sec:evaluations} we discuss the degree to
which the design meets our goals of flexibility and applicability to realistic
security concerns.

\section{Metadata Tags and Policies, by Example}

Consider a straightforward security requirement: ``do not leak high-security values to low-security channels.''
In the example in \cref{fig:ex1}, assume that {\tt psk} is a high-security value and {\tt printi} prints to a low-security
channel, so this code indirectly performs a leak via the local variable {\tt x}.  We now explain how we would use Tagged C
to define a security policy that would prevent this leak. \apt{A whole explanation of
  the basic ideas is missing here: values carry tags, tags are checked at control points, rules are to be instantiated below, etc., etc.} 
\apt{And I think that you need first to explain informally how you want tag checking to work, along the lines of
  ``We have two tags, H and L; the value of psk gets tagged H by virtue of a specific rule on f; the tag is propagated through the arithmetic by a general rule,
  and is caught at the printi by virtue of a specific rule on printi.''  The other control points are mainly distractions, especially
  AccessT and AssignT; perhaps it is best to leave these out of these initial examples.}
\Cref{fig:ex1} maps each of three points
in the execution of {\tt f} to a description of the program state at that point,
with the input value and all tags treated symbolically. Let \(i\) be the value passed to {\tt psk}
and \(\vt_0\) the corresponding tag. \apt{Subscripts should be blue too}. In each state, the first column
shows the active function, the second gives the symbolic values and tags
of variables in the local environment, and the third shows the flow of those tags though
tag rules.

\apt{Why is {\tt x} described before {\tt psk}??}
The initial tag on {\tt x}, \(\vt_1\), comes from the \(\localtname\) tag rule; all locals for a given function
name (which is a parameter to the rule) get the same tag. \apt{Not at all obvious to me (or the reader) why {\tt x} gets an initial
value and tag at all. (Indeed, should it, since it cannot be accessed before it acquires a proper initial value?) Needs an explanation at least, although this is muddying the waters.}
  The tag on {\tt psk}
comes from \(\argtname\), which is parameterized by the tag on the argument value (\(\vt_0\)) and
the names of both the function and the argument. Next, {\tt x} is assigned {\tt psk+5}.
Four tag rules are invoked during this statement: \(\accesstname\) when reading
from {\tt psk}, \(\consttname\) for the tag on the constant, \(\binoptname\) for the addition,
and finally \(\assigntname\) for the assignment into {\tt x}. \(\binoptname\) is parameterized
by the kind of operation in addition to the tags on its inputs.
After the final step, the execution is in the function {\tt printi}, where it consults
\(\argtname\) a second time.

The system can prevent the program from outputting a value derived from {\tt psk} by instantiating these tag rules with
functions that implement {\em secure information flow}. For the tag rules seen so far, the policy given in
\cref{fig:example1rules} does the trick. It defines two tags, \(\high\) and \(\low\), for high
security ({\tt psk} and things derived from it) and low security (everything else.) In tag rules,
the assignment operator := denotes an assignment to the named tag-rule output. \apt{Can we consistently use primed variables for outputs (and say so here)?}
``Case'' statements are sometimes abbreviated by assuming that any input that doesn't match a case causes a failstop.\apt{But that doesn't happen here, so why say it?
You are not writing a reference manual!}

\end{figure}

The interesting rules are \(\binoptname\) and \(\argtname\). \(\binoptname\)
combines two tags, setting the result of a binary operation \(\high\) if either of its arguments are.
\(\argtname\) is parameterized by the name of the function argument being processed.
It tags {\tt psk} \(\high\), and maintains the security level of all other arguments.
But if a \(\high\) value is being passed to a parameter of {\tt printi}, the rule will fail.
So, in this example, we will be unable to generate a tag
\(\vt_5\), and the tag processor will throw a failstop rather than allow execution to continue.

Example \ref{fig:ex2} adds two new wrinkles: we need to keep track of metadata associated with
addresses and with the program's control-flow state. If the variable {\tt mm} represents
a memory-mapped device register that is outside of the program's control, we want to avoid storing the password there. And, by
branching on the password, we risk leaking information that could eventually compromise it even
if we never print it directly (an {\em implicit flow}.)
\apt{Again, describe the tag-based solution informally first.}

Global variables like {\tt mm} are always kept in memory, as are local arrays and structs.
Other parameters and locals are placed in memory if they have their addresses taken.
Objects in memory have additional ``location tags'' that are notionally associated with the memory
itself, which we will denote by metavariable \(\lt\). The store maps their identifier
to their address\apt{???}, along with its own ``pointer tag'' which we will distinguish with the
metavariable \(\pt\). To track metadata about the overall system state, we also add
a special global tag called the PC tag, ranged over by \(\PCT\).

\label{fig:ex2}
\end{figure}

Tagged C initializes the tags on {\tt mm} with the \(\globaltname\) rule. The PC tag
at the point of call, \(\PCT_0\), is fed to \(\calltname\) to determine a new PC tag
inside of {\tt g}. And the if-statement consults the \(\splittname\) rule to update the PC tag
inside of its branch based on the value-tag of the expression {\tt psk < 0}. Once inside the
conditional, when the program assigns to {\tt mm}, it must consult both the
\(\assigntname\) rule as normal and the \(\storetname\) rule because it is storing
to memory.

Because ``don't print the password'' is so similar to ``don't leak the password,'' we can
implement the latter with the same tag type, duplicating most of the rules.\apt{This gives the bogus impression that we expect to write lots of function-specific rules with their own special-purpose tags, etc.} We just need to
deal with memory tags and the PC tag. We will tag memory
locations \(\high\) by default, indicating that they are allowed to contain \(\high\)-tagged values,
but {\tt mm} will be tagged \(\low\). The most interesting rules are:

\begin{figure}
  \globaltruleblock{
    \(\vt:=\low\) \\
    \(\pt:=\low\) \\
    \caseoftwo{x}
              {\tt mm}{\(\lt:=\low\)}
              {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\lt:=\high\)}}
  \truleblock{\(\splittname(\PCT,\vt)\)}{
    \caseoftwo{(\(\PCT,\vt\))}
              {(\(\low,\low\))}{\(\PCT':=\low\)}
              {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\PCT':=\high\)}
  }
  \storetruleblock{
    \(\lt':=\lt\) \\
    \caseofthree{(\(\PCT,\vt,\lt\))}
                {(\(\underline{~~},\underline{~~},\high\))}{\(\vt':=\vt\)}
                {(\(\low,\low,\low\))}{\(\vt':=\vt\)}
                {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\fail\)}
  }
\end{figure}

In this case, \(\splittname\) will set the PC tag to \high, as it branches on a value derived from {\tt psk}.
Then, when it comes time to write to {\tt mm}, \(\storetname\) will fail rather than write to a low address
in a high context.

\apt{Start boldly: ``Tagged C is (almost) full ordinary C.'' Then list exceptions, wherever they come from (CompCert or us). }


Tagged C uses the full syntax of CompCert C \cite{Leroy09:CompCert},
an elaboration\apt{that's a technical term in this context, which I don't think you mean} of the C standard into a formal operational semantics,
with minimal modification\apt{from what?}, with the exception of inline assembly.\apt{as I noted before, that's not part of the standard}
Our semantics (given in full in the appendix) are a small-step reduction
semantics which differ from CompCert C's in two key respects. First, Tagged C's semantics contain
{\em control points}: hooks within the
operational semantics at which the tag policy is consulted and either tags are updated, or the system
failstops. (\apt{This remark would be more useful in the intro.}) A control point consists of the name of a {\em tag rule}
and the bindings of its inputs and outputs. Take, for example, the expression step reduction
for binary operations, below. On the left, the ``tagless'' version of the rule reduces a
binary operation on two input values to a single value by applying the operation.
On the left, the Tagged C version adds tags to the operands and the result, with the result tag
derived from the \(\binoptname\) rule.

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.37\textwidth}
  \binopsteptagless
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
  \binopstep
\end{minipage}

The tag rule itself is instantiated as a partial function; if a policy leaves a tag rule
undefined on some inputs, then those inputs are considered to violate the policy, sending
execution into a special failstop state. The names and signatures of the tag rules,
and their corresponding control points, are listed in \Cref{fig:controlpoints}.\apt{It wouldn't hurt to
  talk briefly through these rules, especially when the connection between rule name and control point
  is not obvious. And make a point of
  saying: ``and this is all there are or ever will be (we hope)''}

\apt{This para, which I rewrote to be a bit more positive, could go much earlier in the paper.}
The choice of control points and their associations with tag rules, as well as the tag rules'
signatures, form the essence of Tagged C's design. 
We have validated our design on the three classes of policies explored in this paper,
and, outside of a few known limitation discussed in \ref{??}\apt{e.g. substructural memory safety},
we believe it is sufficiently expressive to describe most other flow-based policies, although
of course further experience may reveal unexpected deficiencies. 

The second major semantic distinction between Tagged C and CompCert C is that Tagged C has no
memory-undefined behavior. CompCert C models memory as a collection of blocks of offsets,
and treats all variables as having their own block. Tagged C instead follows Concrete C
\cite{} [Need something to cite!] in separating variables into public and private data.\apt{No, you will need to explain Concrete C in more detail}
Public data (all heap data, globals, arrays, structs, and address-taken locals) share a single flat address
space, where its behavior is implementation defined. \sna{Technically right?\apt{but not very informative. You should simply describe how your memory model works. then we
can add some language justifying why this is an interesting model in its own right.}}
Private data (non-address-taken locals and parameters) have a separate store.

%Without memory safety, programs
%that exhibit memory-undefined behavior will act as their compiled equivalents would, potentially
%corrupting memory; we expect that a memory safety policy will be a standard default, but that the
%strictness of the policy may need to be tuned for programs that use low-level idioms.

\paragraph*{Parts of a policy}

A policy consists of instantiations of the tag type
and each of the tag rules associated with control points in the semantics. Table \cref{figcontrolpoints}
identifies the full collection of control points, their tag rules, and the inputs and outputs of the tag rules.
The tag type \(\tau\) must be inhabited by a default tag.

\paragraph*{Identifiers}

Identifiers are a C source-level construct, and a policy designer might want to operate on them,
so we embed them in tags. These are called {\em name tags}. We give name tags to the
following constructions and identify them as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function identifiers, \(\FN\)
\item Function arguments, \(\AN\)
\item Global variables, \(\GN\)
\item Labels, \(\LN\)
\item Types, \(\TN\)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Combining Policies}

Multiple policies can be enforced in parallel. If policy \(A\) has tag type \(\tau_A\)
and policy \(B\) has \(\tau_B\), then policy \(A \times B\) should have tag type
\(\tau = \tau_A \times \tau_B\). Its tag rules should apply the rules of \(A\) to
the left projection of all inputs and the rules of \(B\) to the right projection
to generate the components of the new tag. If either side failstops, the entire
rule should failstop.

\apt{Need to describe the limits on this idea, namely when policies are not completely
  orthogonal. For example, a compartmentalization policy is likely to overlap a generic
  memory safety policy.}

This process can be applied to any number of different policies, allowing for instance
a combination of a baseline memory safety policy with several more targeted
information-flow policies.

\section{Example Policies}
\label{sec:policies}

In this section, we will discuss concrete policy implementations and the way
that they have motivated our control point design. First, memory safety policies
inform our requirements for memory tags as well as type casts. Compartmentalization
policies depend on the call- and return-related control points, to keep track of the
active compartment. And secure information flow (SIF) policies show us the many places
where the user may need to reference identifiers from their program in the policy itself.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Tagged C aims to combine the flexibility of tag-based architectures with the abstraction
of a high-level language. How well have we achieved this aim?

[Here we list criteria and evaluate how we fulfilled them]

\begin{itemize}
\item Flexibility: we demonstrate three policies that can be used alone or in conjunction
\item Applicability: we support the full complement of C language features and give definition
  to many undefined C programs
\item Practical security: our example security policies are based on important security concepts
  from the literature
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

By committing to a tag-based mechanism, we do restrict the space of policies that Tagged C
can enforce. In general, a reference monitor can enforce any policy that constitutes a
{\em safety property}---any policy whose violation can be demonstrated by a single finite
trace. This class includes such policies as ``no integer overflow'' and ``pointers are always in-bounds,''
which depend on the values of variables. Tag-based monitors cannot enforce any policy that
depends on the value of a variable rather than its tags. \apt{But perhaps note that tag-based
  policies can express some trace properties more easily than value-based policies could, essentially
  because tags can summarize the relevant parts of the trace history.}

\apt{Something about malloc tagging, and type-based tagging in general.}

Due to our approach to tagging memory uniformly at allocation time, Tagged C cannot easily
enforce substructural memory safety. Versions of memory safety that protect fields of a
struct from overflows within the same struct would be very useful, but currently enforcing
them will require manual initialization.

Beyond these, there is always the possibility that we have missed some control point
that would enable interesting security policies outside of the areas we have considered.
How hard would it be to add control points, or extend the ones that exist? That depends
whether the extension in question would impact compilation strategies. For instance,
we have avoided control points that allow updates to their operand tags, although
this could be useful in enforcing policies that attempt to maintain the uniqueness of tags,
because tag-based hardware is unlikely to support linear tags, so any such updates would
need the compiler to generate extra instructions.

\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Reference Monitors}

The concept of a reference monitor was first introduced fifty years ago~\cite{Anderson72:PlanningStudy}
as a tamper-proof and verifiable subsystem that checks every security-relevant operation in a system to
ensure that it conforms to a security {\em policy} (a general specification of acceptable behavior~\cite{Goguen82:SecurityPolicies}).

A reference monitor can be implemented at any level of a system. An {\em inline reference monitor}\cite{??}
is a purely compiler-based system that inserts checks at appropriate places in the code.
Alternatively, a reference monitor might be embedded in the operating system, or in an interpreted
language's runtime. A {\em hardware reference monitor} instead provides primitives at the ISA-level
that accelerate security and make it harder to subvert.

Programmable Interlocks for Policy Enforcement (PIPE) \cite{Dhawan14:PUMP} is a hardware extension
that uses {\em metadata tagging}. Each register and each word of memory is associated with
an additional array of bits called a tag. The policy is decomposed into a set of {\em tag rules}
that act in parallel with each executing instruction, using the tags on its operands to
decide whether the instruction is legal and, if so, determine which tags to place on its results.
PIPE tags are large relative to other tag-based hardware, giving it the flexibility
to implement complex policies with structured tags, and even run multiple policies at once.

Other hardware monitors include Arm MTE, STAR, and CHERI.
Arm MTE aims to enforce a narrow form of memory safety using 4-bit tags, which distinguish adjacent objects
in memory from one another, preventing buffer overflows, but not necessarily other memory violations.
[TODO: read the Binghamton paper, figure out where they sit here.] 

CHERI is capability machine [TODO: cite OG CHERI]. In CHERI, capabilities
are ``fat pointers'' carrying extra bounds and permission information, and capability-protected
memory can only be accessed via a capability with the appropriate privilege. This is a natural
way to enforce spatial memory safety, and techniques have been demonstrated for enforcing
temporal safety \cite{NWF20:Cornucopia}, stack safety \cite{Skorstengaard19:stktokens},
and compartmentalization [TODO: figure out what to cite], with varying degrees of ease and
efficiency. But CHERI cannot easily enforce notions of security based on dataflow,
such as Secure Information Flow.

In this paper, we describe a programming language with an abstract reference monitor.
We realize it as an interpreter with the reference monitor built in, and envision
eventually compiling to PIPE-equipped hardware. An inlining compiler would also be plausible.
As a result of this choice, our abstract reference monitor uses a PIPE-esque notion of
tags.\apt{A grot-esque coinage.}

\paragraph{Aspect Oriented Programming}

[TODO: do forward search from original AOP paper]

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

We have presented the language and a reference interpreter, built on top of the CompCert interpreter
\cite{Leroy09:CompCert}, and three example policies. There are several significant next-steps.

\paragraph{Compilation}

An interpreter is all well and good\apt{too informal}, but a compiler would be preferable for many reasons.
A compiled Tagged C could use the hardware acceleration of a PIPE target, and could more easily
support linked libraries, including linking against code written in other languages.
The ultimate goal would be a fully verified compiler, but that is a very long way off\apt{too informal}.


\paragraph{Language Proofs}

There are a couple of properties of the language semantics itself that we would like to prove.
Namely (1) that its behavior (prior to adding a policy) matches that of CompCert C and
(2) that the behavior of a given program is invariant under all policies up to truncation due
to failstop.

\paragraph{Policy Correctness Proofs}

For each example policy discussed in this paper, we sketched a formal specification for the
security property it ought to enforce. A natural continuation would be to prove the correctness
of each policy against these specifications.

\paragraph{Policy DSL}

Currently, policies are written in Gallina, the language embedded in Coq. This is fine for a
proof-of-concept, but not satisfactory for real use. We plan to develop a domain-specific policy
language to make it easier to write Tagged C policies.

\appendix

\section{Syntax}

Tagged C has the full complement of typical C expressions (\cref{fig:expr}). \(\val{v}{\vt}\),
\(\loc{p}{\pt}\), and \(\paren{\expr}{\type}\) are internal forms.
A constant \(c\) in the concrete syntax is transformed into \(\val{c}{\constt}\),
and in general \(\val{v}{\vt}\) is a fully-reduced right-hand value. \(\loc{p}{\pt}\)
is a fully-reduced left-hand value that represents the address of a variable.
\(\paren{\expr}{\type}\) is the result of a conditional or shortcutting
expression, with \(\type\) being a type annotation in case the result needs to
be cast.

\begin{figure}
  \[\begin{aligned}
  \expr ::= & \val{v}{\vt} & \textnormal{Value} \\
  | & \var{x} & \textnormal{Variable} \\
  | & \field{\expr}{id} & \textnormal{Field} \\
  | & \valof{\expr} & \textnormal{Load from Object} \\
  | & \deref{\expr} & \textnormal{Dereference Pointer} \\
  | & \addrof{\expr} & \textnormal{Address of Object} \\
  | & \unop{\odot}{\expr} & \textnormal{Unary Operator} \\
  | & \binop{\oplus}{\expr_1}{\expr_2} & \textnormal{Binary Operator} \\
  | & \cast{\expr}{ty} & \textnormal{Cast} \\
  | & \condition{\expr_1}{\expr_2}{\expr_3} & \textnormal{Conditional} \\
  | & \sizeof{ty} & \textnormal{Size of Type} \\
  | & \alignof{ty} & \textnormal{Alignment of Type} \\
  | & \assign{\expr_1}{\expr_2} & \textnormal{Assignment} \\
  | & \assignop{\oplus}{\expr_1}{\expr_2} & \textnormal{Operator Assignment} \\
  | & \postinc{\oplus}{\expr} & \textnormal{Post-Increment/Decrement} \\
  | & \comma{\expr_1}{\expr_2} & \textnormal{Expression Sequence} \\
  | & \call{\expr_f}{\overline{\expr}_{args}} & \textnormal{Function Call} \\
  | & \loc{l}{\lt} & \textnormal{Memory Location} \\
  | & \paren{\expr}{ty}{\gentag} & \textnormal{Parenthetical with Optional Cast} \\
  \end{aligned}\]
  \caption{Expression Syntax}
  \label{fig:expr}
\end{figure}

Some common C expressions are derived forms. An array index expression,
\(\expr_1[\expr_2]\) expands to \(\deref{\binop{+}{\expr_1}{\expr_2}}\).
The pre-increment  expression \(++\expr\) expands to
\(\assign{\expr}{\binop{+}{\expr}{1@\constt}}\), and likewise for pre-decrement.

Similarly, statements cover the full C standard. Conditional statements
carry optional labels as internal forms, so that an if statement in the
concrete syntax becomes \(\sifthenelse{\expr}{\stmt_1}{\stmt_2}{\bot}\).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
    \[\begin{aligned}
    \stmt ::= & \sskip \\
    | & \sdo{\expr} \\
    | & \sseq{\stmt_1}{\stmt_2} \\

    | & \scontinue \\
    | & \sreturn \\
    | & \sswitch{\expr}{\overline{(L,\stmt)}} \\
    | & \slabel{L}{\stmt} \\
    | & \sgoto{L} \\    
    \end{aligned}\]
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.69\textwidth}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Tagged C Abstract Syntax}

\end{figure}

\section{States}

States can be of several kinds, denoted by their script prefix: a {\em general state} \(\mathcal{S}(\dots)\),
an {\em expression state} \(\mathcal{E}(\dots)\), a {\em call state} \(\mathcal{C}(\dots)\), or a
{\em return state} \(\mathcal{R}(\dots)\). Finally, the special state {\em failstop} (\(\mathcal{F}(\dots)\))
represents a tag failure, and carries the state that produced the failure.
[Allison: to whatever degree you've figured out what is useful here by publication-time, we can
  tune this to be more specific.]

In the below definition, memories are ranged over by \(\mem\), local environments by
\(\lenv\), and continuations by \(\cont\).

\[\begin{aligned}
S ::= & \sstate{\PCT}{\mem}{\stmt}{\cont} \\
| & \estate{\PCT}{\mem}{\expr}{\cont} \\
| & \cstate{f}{\PCT}{\mem}{\lenv}{f'}{\overline{\val{v}{\vt}}}{\cont} \\
| & \rstate{\PCT}{\mem}{\genv}{\lenv}{\val{v}{\vt}}{\cont} \\
| & \fstate{S} \\
\end{aligned}\]


States in general contain a memory, a local environment, and a continuation.

\subsection{Memories}

\subsection{Environments}

\subsection{Continuations}
\label{app:continuations}

A continuation acts like a stack of pending operations. The base of the stack is
\(\kemp\). \(\mathit{Kdo}\) indicates that a do statement is evaluating an expression.
\(\mathit{Kseq}\) with parameter \(\stmt\) indicates that, after the current statement
is done executing, \(\stmt\) is next. \(\mathit{Kif}\) means that execution is evaluating
the test expression of an if statement, and its parameters are the branches of the
if. Similarly, the test continuations for while, do-while, and for loops indicate that
the test expression is being evaluated. The associated loop continuations indicate that
execution is in the loop body. They continuations carry all of the information of the original
loop.

\[\begin{split}
\cont ::= & \kemp \\
| & \kdo{\cont} \\
| & \kseq{\stmt}{\cont} \\
| & \kif{\stmt_1}{\stmt_2}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kwhiletest{\expr}{\stmt}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kwhileloop{\expr}{\stmt}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kdowhiletest{\expr}{\stmt}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kdowhileloop{\expr}{\stmt}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kfor{\expr}{\stmt_2}{\stmt_3}{L}{\cont} \\
| & \kforpost{\expr}{\stmt_2}{\stmt_3}{L}{\cont} \\
\end{split}\]


\section{Initial State}

Given a list \(xs\) of variable identifiers \(id\) and types
\(ty\), a program's initial memory is defined by iteratively allocating each one
in memory and updating the global environment with its base address, bound, type,
and a static identity tag. Let \(|ty|\) be a function from types to their sizes
in bytes. The memory is initialized \(\vundef@\vt@\lt\)
for some \(\vt\) and \(\lt\), unless given an initializer.
Let \(\mem_0\) and \(\genv_0\) be the initial (empty) memory and environment.
The parameter \(b\) marks the start of the global region.

%Since we don't need to initialize tags in memory dynamically, our rule for
%selecting these tags can cover the entire initialization of the memory with arbitrary
%granularity. We represent this as a list of tags of length \(|ty|\).

\[\mathit{globals} ~ xs ~ b =
\begin{cases}
  (\mem_0, \genv_0) & \textnormal{if } xs = \varepsilon \\
  (\mem[p \dots p+|ty| \mapsto \vundef@\vt@\lt]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } xs = (id,ty)::xs' \\
  ~ \genv[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) & \textnormal{and } \trule{\globaltres}{\globalt} \\
  & \textnormal{where } (\mem,\genv) = \mathit{globals} ~ xs' ~ (b + |ty|) \\
\end{cases}\]

\section{Step Rules}
\label{app:rules}

\subsection{Sequencing rules}

\sequencing

\subsection{Conditional rules}

\conditionals

\subsection{Loop rules}

\loops

\subsection{Contexts}
\label{app:contexts}

Our expression semantics are contextual. A context \(\ctx[\expr]_k\) is a function from an
expression to an expression, with a ``kind'' flag \(k\) (left-hand or right-hand, \(\lh\) or \(\rh\)).

\[\begin{aligned}
\ctx{\expr}_\lh ::= \\
| & \expr & \\ % ctx_top
| & \deref{\ctx{\expr}_\rh} \\ % ctx_deref
| & \field{\ctx{\expr}_\rh}{id} \\ % ctx_field
\end{aligned}\]

\[\begin{aligned}
\ctx{\expr}_\rh ::= \\
| & \expr & \\ % ctx_top
| & \valof{\ctx{\expr}_\lh} \\ % ctx_rvalof
| & \addrof{\ctx{\expr}_\lh} \\ % ctx_addrof
| & \unop{\odot}{\ctx{\expr}_\rh} \\ % ctx_unop
| & \binop{\oplus}{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_binop_left
| & \binop{\oplus}{\expr_1}{\ctx{\expr_2}_\rh} \\ % ctx_binop_right
| & \cast{\ctx{\expr}_\rh}{\type} \\ % ctx_cast
| & \seqand{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_seqand
| & \seqor{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_seqor
| & \condition{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\expr_2}{\expr_3} \\ % ctx_condition
| & \assign{\ctx{\expr_1}_\lh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_assign_left
| & \assign{\expr_1}{\ctx{\expr_2}_\rh} \\ % ctx_assign_right
| & \assignop{\oplus}{\ctx{\expr_1}_\lh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_assignop_left
| & \assignop{\oplus}{\expr_1}{\ctx{\expr_2}_\rh} \\ % ctx_assignop_right
| & \postinc{\oplus}{\ctx{\expr}_\lh} \\ % ctx_postinc
| & \call{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\overline{\expr_2}} \\ % ctx_call_left
| & \call{\expr_1}{\ctx{\overline{\expr_2}}_\rh} \\ % ctx_call_right
% skipped builtins
| & \comma{\ctx{\expr_1}_\rh}{\expr_2} \\ % ctx_comma
| & \paren{\ctx{\expr}_\rh}{\type}{} \\ % ctx_paren
\end{aligned}\]

A left-hand reduction \(\expr \Rightarrow_\lh \expr'\)
relates an expression to an expression. A right-hand reduction
\((\PCT,\mem,\expr) \Rightarrow_\rh (\PCT',\mem',\expr')\)
relates a triple of PC Tag, memory, and expression to another such triple.
Given these reduction relations, we construct step rules for contexts in
expressions.

%triple of a memory, an expression, and a tag
%might reduces to another such triple as a left-hand, right-hand, or call reduction, written
%\((\mem, \expr, \PCT) \Rightarrow_k (\mem', \expr', \PCT')\),
%based on rules given below. These reductions are embedded in states as follows.

\judgmenttwo{\(\ctx{\expr}_\lh\)}
            {\(\expr \Rightarrow_\lh \expr'\)}
            {\(\defestate{\ctx{\expr}} \longrightarrow \defestate{\ctx{\expr'}}\)}

\judgmenttwo{\(\ctx{\expr}_\rh\)}
            {\((\PCT, \mem, \expr) \Rightarrow_\rh (\PCT', \mem', \expr')\)}
            {\(\defestate{\ctx{\expr}} \longrightarrow \estate{\PCT'}{\mem'}{\ctx{\expr'}}{\cont}\)}
            
All that remains is to give the expression reductions themselves.

\expressions

\subsection{Call and Return Rules}

In order to make a call, we need to reduce the function expression to an \(\floc{\_}\) value, an
abstract location corresponding to a particular function. Then we can make the call.

\callexprstep

When we make an internal call, we need to allocated space for locals and arguments using the helper function
\(\mathit{frame}\).

\[\mathit{frame} ~ xs ~ as ~ \mem =
\begin{cases}
  (\mem''[p \mapsto \vundef@\vt@\lt]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } xs = (id,ty)::xs' \\
  \lenv'[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) &
  \textnormal{where } (\mem',p) \leftarrow \mathit{stack\_alloc} ~ |ty| ~ \mem, \\
  & \trule{\localtres}{\localt}, \\
  & \textnormal{and } (\mem'',\lenv') = \mathit{frame} ~ xs' ~ as ~ m' \\ 
  \\
  (\mem''[p \mapsto v@\vt'@\lt]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } as = (id,ty,v @ \vt)::as' \textnormal{ and } xs = \varepsilon \\
  \lenv'[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) &
  \textnormal{where } (\mem',p) \leftarrow \mathit{stack\_alloc} ~ |ty| ~ \mem, \\
  & \trule{\argtres}{\argt}, \\
  & \textnormal{and } (\mem'',\lenv') = \mathit{frame} ~ xs' ~ as ~ m' \\
  \\
  (\mem, \lambda x . \bot) & \textnormal{if } xs = \varepsilon \textnormal{ and } as = \varepsilon \\
\end{cases}\]

\callstep

On the other hand, when we make an external call, we step directly to a return state with some value
being returned and an updated memory. [TODO: talk more about how the tag policy applies in external
  functions, what they can and can't do with tags.]

\extcallstep

Special external functions, such as malloc, just get their own rules.

\mallocstep

And finally, we have the return rules.

%\section{Moved from Intro}

%\sna{I'm organizing our diss tracks into paragraphs that we can cut or move as needed}
%\paragraph*{Why Dynamic?}
  
%  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to fully secure C code before run-time.
%  Ideally, bugs would be quickly identified and then fixed promptly. 
%  That is not always possible for a variety of reasons: bugs may escape detection, 
%  require significant effort to diagnose, or be impractical to fix. 
%  There are many techniques for finding bugs, but there is a shared stumbling block: C is not 
%  well defined. We cannot always agree on when something is a bug in C, especially code using
%  Undefined Behaviors (UB) \cite{defactoC}. Confusion around expected behavior is no small problem. 
%  There are 191 undefined behaviors and 52 unspecified behaviors in the C99 
%  specification \cite{Csmith}. Sometimes these behaviors are benign and skillfully 
%  used by the developer, other times they are unintended and highly dangerous. 
%  Unfortunately the distinction between the two is easily lost. 
%  Discerning expert code review is considered best practice, although it is 
%  rarely perfectly successful \cite{} % https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-36563-8_14 }
%  even if an expert is available at all. Even when there is both consensus 
%  and detection of a bug\apt{??} \amn{we can find it at and we can agree its a problem that should be fixed}, 
%  changing the code may not be possible because  
%  it is in proprietary 3rd party libraries and drivers, or because
%  regulations prohibit changes \cite{Bessey10:Coverity}.

%  \apt{last clause is mysterious} \amn {
%    for example FDA approval used to forbid patching because you'd have to go through recertification. 
%    So healthcare wouldn't patch. SNA pointed out the coverity paper comments on this as a reason for 
%    bugs not getting fixed}

%  \paragraph*{Why C-Level?}
%  Tag-based enforcement in general has a significant body of work at the assembly level, especially
%  PIPE (Programmable Interlocks for Policy Enforcement) \cite{}. However, even at the assembly-level
%  these systems need the compiler to be in the trusted computing base (TCB), as many policies require
%  knowledge of source-level constructs, even ones that do not depend on detailed knowledge of the program's
%  behavior [cite Nick and Andre; anyone else?]. Moving policy-definition to the source level therefore
%  does not expand the TCB and allows C developers to reason about policies in terms of the language that
%  they program in regularly.

%  \paragraph*{Notations}
%  Values are ranged over by \(v\), variable identifiers by \(x\), and function identifiers by \(f\).
%Tags use a number of metavariables: \(t\) ranges over all tags, while we will use
%\(\vt\) to refer to the tags associated with values, \(\pt\) for tags on pointer values
%and memory-location expressions, \(\lt\) for tags associated with memory locations themselves,
%\(\nt\) for ``name tags'' automatically derived from identifiers, \(\PCT\) for the
%global ``program counter tag'' or PC tag.
%An {\it atom} is a pair of a value and a tag, \(\val{v}{\vt}\); the @ symbol should be read
%as a pair in general, and is used when the second object in the pair is a tag.
%Expressions are ranged over by \(\expr\), statements by \(\stmt\), and continuations by \(\cont\).
%The continuations are defined in \cref{app:continuations}, and step rules in \cref{app:rules}.

%A memory is an array of bytes, where each byte is part of an atom.
%Each byte is also associated with a ``location tag'' \(\lt\). When a contiguous region of \(s\) bytes
%starting at location \(l\) comprise an atom \(v@\vt\), and their locations tags comprise the list \(\lts\),
%we write \(\mem[l]_s = v@\vt @\lts\). Likewise, \(\mem[l \dots l + s \mapsto v@\vt @ \lts]_s\)
%denotes storing that many bytes. Visually, we will represent whole atoms in memory as condensed boxes,
%with their location tags separate.

\end{document}
