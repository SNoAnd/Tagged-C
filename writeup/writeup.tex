\begin{abstract}
Today's computing infrastructure is built atop layers of legacy C code, often
insecure, poorly understood, and/or difficult to maintain.
These foundations may be shored up with dynamic security enforcement.
% and potentially introduce regressions.
Tagged C is a C variant with a built-in {\em tag-based reference monitor}.
It can express a variety of dynamic security policies and enforce them with
compiler and/or hardware support.

Tagged C expresses security policies at the level familiar to C developers: that
of the C source code rather than the ISA. It is comprehensive in supporting different
approaches to security as well as more or less restrictive policies. We demonstrate
this range by providing examples of {\em memory safety}, {\em compartmentalization},
and {\em secure information flow} (SIF) policies. We also give a semantics and reference
interpreter for Tagged C.

\section{Introduction}
Many essential technologies rely on new and old C code. 
Operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX, BSD), databases (Oracle, sqlite3), the internet
(Apache, NGNIX, NetBSD, Cisco IOS), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the 
embedded devices that run our homes and hospitals are built in and on C \cite{Munoz:PoweredbyC}. 
C is not a relic; more than a third of professional programmers report active developing
in C today \cite{stackoverflow22:dev-survey}. The safety of these essential technologies
depends on the security of their underlying C codebases. Insecurity might take the form of
%(1)
undefined behavior such as memory errors (e.g. buffer overflows, heap leaks, double-free),
%(2)
logic errors (e.g. sql injection, input-sanitization flaws), or
%(3)
larger-scale architectural flaws (e.g. over-provisioning access rights.)

Although static analyses can detect and mitigate many C insecurities, the last line of defense against
undetected or unfixable vulnerabilities is runtime enforcement. Ideally an engineer can
tune enforcement to the security needs of the system, rather than apply conservative, one-size-fits-all 
restrictions. 
We introduce Tagged C: a general-purpose dynamic tag-based enforcement language
that allows developers to define flexible security policies in terms of a familiar source language.
Applications of Tagged C include defining undefined behaviors (UBs) involving memory,
specifying detailed information flow policies, and enforcing arbitrary mandatory access control rules. % OK to still say this when we aren't showing it?
%Importantly, a security policy can be modified without recompilation unless it is optimized as described in
%\cref{sec:optionals}.

Tagged C's novel approach is that it is a \emph{general-purpose} scheme for specifying security
policies at the \emph{source level}, using a tag-based reference monitor.
This style of monitor associates a metadata tag with the data in the underlying system.
Throughout execution it updates these tags according to a set a predefined rules, or halts if
the program would violate a rule. We are motivated by PIPE (Programmable Interlocks for Policy Enforcement)
\cite{}, an ISA extension that implements such a reference monitor in hardware. 
While our scheme is general and could be implemented in software, we aim for compatibility
with PIPE as a likely hardware target. PIPE is notable among similar systems such as ARM MTE
and [that thing from Binghamton] in that its tags are very large---typically the size of words
in the underlying ISA. This makes PIPE extremely flexible and able to run multiple policies at once.
TODO: non-recompilation?]

Tagged C consists of an underlying semantics that establishes the baseline concrete behavior of programs
with no policies, and a set of {\em control points} at which the semantics consult a user-defined set of
{\em tag rules}. For convenience we build our underlying semantics on the CompCert C semantics, which are formalized 
as part of the CompCert verified compiler \cite{Leroy09:CompCert}. We provide a reference interpreter
also based on that of CompCert, for use in executing prototype policies. Tag rules are written directly as Gallina
functions.

\paragraph{Contributions}

We offer the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item The design of a comprehensive set of {\em control points} at which the language interfaces with the policy
\item Tagged C policies implementing (1) compartmentalization,
  (2) a realistic, permissive memory model from the literature (PVI),
  and (3) Secure Information Flow (SIF)
\item A full formal semantic definition for Tagged C, formalized in Coq, describing how the control points
  interact with programs
\item A Tagged C interpreter, implemented in Coq and extracted to Ocaml
\end{itemize}

[TODO: rework]
In the next section, we give a high-level introduction of metadata-tagging: how it works,
and how its use can improve security. Then in \cref{sec:semantics}, we briefly discuss the
language as a whole, before moving into policies in \cref{sec:policies}. Finally, in
\cref{sec:evaluations} we discuss the degree to
which the design meets our goals of flexibility and applicability to realistic
security concerns.

\section{What is Metadata Tagging?}

Consider a seemingly straightforward security requirement: ``do not leak the passkey.''
In the following example, {\tt psk} is passed to {\tt f} as an argument, copied to
a local variable, and then printed---clearly a violation. We can examine the states at
three points to see how its input value \(i\) moves through the system. The first column
of each state shows the active function, the second gives the symbolic values (and tags)
of variables in the local environment, and the third shows the origins of those tags in
tag rules.

Going step-by-step: the initial tag on {\tt x}, \(\vt_1\), comes from the \(\localtname\) tag rule,
which can be specialized by the identity of the current function. The tag on {\tt psk}
comes from \(\argtname\), which is parameterized by the tag on the argument value (\(\vt_0\)) and
the identities of both the function and the argument. Next, {\tt x} is assigned {\tt psk+5}.
There are four total tag rules invoked during this statement: \(\accesstname\) when reading
from {\tt psk}, \(\consttname\) for the tag on the constant, \(\binoptname\) for the addition,
and finally \(\assigntname\) for the assignment into {\tt x}. \(\binoptname\) is parameterized
by the identity of the operation in addition to the tags on its inputs.
After the final step, the execution is in the function {\tt printi}, where it consults
\(\argtname\) a second time.

The system can prevent the program from outputting {\tt psk} by instantiating these tag rules with
functions that implement {\em secure information flow}. For the tag rules seen so far, the policy given in
\cref{fig:example1rules} would do the trick. It defines two tags, \(\high\) and \(\low\), for high
security ({\tt psk} and things derived from it) and low security (everything else.) In tag rules,
the assignment operator := denotes an assignment to the named tag-rule output. ``Case'' statements
may be abbreviated by assuming that any input that doesn't match a case causes a failstop.

  \end{minipage}

  \caption{Secure Information Flow (pt. 1)}
  \label{fig:example1rules}
\end{figure}

The interesting rules are \(\binoptname\) and \(\argtname\). \(\binoptname\)
combines two tags, setting the result of a binary operation \(\high\) if either of its arguments are.
\(\argtname\) is parameterized by the identifier of the function argument being processed.
It tags {\tt psk} \(\high\), and maintains the security level of all other arguments.
But if a \(\high\) value is being passed to a parameter of {\tt printi}, the rule will fail.
So, in this example, we will be unable to generate a tag
\(\vt_5\), and the tag processor will throw a failstop rather than allow execution to continue.

Example \ref{fig:ex2} adds two new wrinkles: we need to keep track of metadata associated with
addresses and with the program's control-flow state. If the variable {\tt mm} represents
mmapped memory that can be seen publicly, we want to avoid storing the password there. And, by
branching on the password, we risk leaking information that could eventually compromise it even
if we never print it directly (an {\em implicit flow}.)

Global variables like {\tt mm} are always kept in memory, as are locals with reference types like arrays.
Other parameters and locals are placed in memory if they have their addresses taken.
Objects in memory have additional ``location tags'' that are notionally associated with the memory
itself, which we will range over with \(\lt\) by convention. The store maps their identifier
to their address, along with its own ``pointer tag'' which we will distinguish with the
metavariable \(\pt\). To track metadata about the overall system state, we also add
a special global tag called the PC Tag, ranged over by \(\PCT\).

\caption{Implicit Flows and Memory}
\label{fig:ex2}
\end{figure}

Tagged C initializes the tags on {\tt mm} with the \(\globaltname\) rule. The PC Tag
at the point of call, \(\PCT_0\), is fed to \(\calltname\) to determine a new PC Tag
inside of {\tt g}. And the if-statement consults the \(\splittname\) rule to update the PC Tag
inside of its branch based on the value-tag of the expression {\tt psk < 0}. Once inside the
conditional, when the program assigns to {\tt mm}, it must consult both the
\(\assigntname\) rule as normal and the \(\storetname\) rule because it is storing
to memory.

To upgrade our ``don't print the password'' policy to ``don't leak the password,'' we can
keep most of our rules the same, or extend them in natural ways. Crucially, we will tag memory
locations \(\high\) by default, indicating that they are allowed to contain \(\high\)-tagged values,
but {\tt mm} will be tagged \(\low\). The most interesting rules are:

\begin{figure}
  \globaltruleblock{
    \(\vt:=\low\) \\
    \(\pt:=\low\) \\
    \caseoftwo{x}
              {\tt mm}{\(\lt:=\low\)}
              {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\lt:=\high\)}}
  \truleblock{\(\splittname(\PCT,\vt)\)}{
    \caseoftwo{(\(\PCT,\vt\))}
              {(\(\low,\low\))}{\(\PCT':=\low\)}
              {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\PCT':=\high\)}
  }
  \storetruleblock{
    \(\lt':=\lt\) \\
    \caseofthree{(\(\PCT,\vt,\lt\))}
                {(\(\underline{~~},\underline{~~},\high\))}{\(\vt':=\vt\)}
                {(\(\low,\low,\low\))}{\(\vt':=\vt\)}
                {\(\underline{~~~}\)}{\(\fail\)}
  }
\end{figure}

In this case, \(\splittname\) will set the PC Tag to \high, as it branches on a value derived from {\tt psk}.
Then, when it comes time to write to {\tt mm}, \(\storetname\) will fail rather than write to a low address
in a high context.

\section{The Language, Informally}
\label{sec:language}

Tagged C uses the full syntax of CompCert C \cite{Leroy09:CompCert} with minimal modification (\cref{fig:syntax}).
There are two notable syntactical differences in the language, relative to CompCert C:
conditionals and loops take an optional {\em join point} label, and parenthetical expressions
an optional ``context tag.''

Our semantics are a small-step reduction semantics which differ from CompCert C's in
two key respects. These are given in full in the appendix. First, Tagged C's semantics contain
{\em control points}: hooks within the
operational semantics at which the tag policy is consulted and either tags are updated, or the system
failstops. (Control points resemble ``advice points'' in aspect-oriented programming, but narrowly
focused on the manipulation of tags.) A control point consists of the name of a {\em tag rule}
and the bindings of its inputs and outputs; a tag rule is a partial function. The names and
signatures of the tag rules, and their corresponding control points, are listed in \Cref{fig:controlpoints}.

Second, there is no memory-undefined behavior: the source semantics reflect a
concrete target-level view of memory as a flat address space. Without memory safety, programs
that exhibit memory-undefined behavior will act as their compiled equivalents would, potentially
corrupting memory; we expect that a memory safety policy will be a standard default, but that the
strictness of the policy may need to be tuned for programs that use low-level idioms.

The choice of control points and their associations with tag rules, as well as the tag rules'
signatures, are a crucial design element. Our proposed design is sufficient for the three classes of
policy that we explore in this paper, but it may not be complete.

\paragraph*{Parts of a policy}

A policy consists of instantiations of the tag type
and each of the tag rules associated with control points in the semantics. Table \cref{figcontrolpoints}
identifies the full collection of control points, their tag rules, and the inputs and outputs of the tag rules.
The tag type \(\tau\) must be inhabited by a default tag.

\paragraph*{Identifiers}

Identifiers are a C source-level construct, and a policy designer might want to operate on them,
so we embed them in tags. These are called {\em name tags}. We give name tags to the
following constructions and identify them as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function identifiers, \(\FN\)
\item Function arguments, \(\AN\)
\item Global variables, \(\GN\)
\item Labels, \(\LN\)
\item Types, \(\TN\)
\end{itemize}

\section{Tags and Policies}
\label{sec:policies}

The heart of Tagged C is in its security policies. Using the control points shown in \cref{sec:language},
we will walk through three example policies: PVI memory safety, compartmentalization, and
secure information flow.

[TODO: discussion of combining policies]

\subsection{PVI Memory Safety}
\label{sec:PVI}

Memory safety is defined relative to a {\em memory model}---a formal or informal description of
how a high-level language handles memory. The memory model associated with the C standard leaves
many behavior undefined, including some that are in use in practice \cite{Memarian16:DeFacto}.
Memarian et al. have proposed two alternatives that define useful subsets of these behaviors
\cite{Memarian19:ExploringCSemantics}. We choose their ``provenance via integer'' (PVI) memory model
as our example. 

Variations of memory safety have been enforced in PIPE already, but usually using
an ad hoc memory model. PVI has the virtue of giving definition to many memory UBs in which a pointer is
cast to an integer, subjected to various arithmetic operations, and cast back to a pointer.
Their second memory model, {\it PNVI} (provenance not via integer), is even more permissive.
We can also enforce it in Tagged C, though its security value is questionable, and we will
not describe it in this paper.

For a policy to enforce PVI, it should not failstop on any program that is defined in PVI.
However, it should failstop if and when a program reaches UB. For example, low-level code
that uses the lower-order bits of a pointer to store a flag (\cref{fig:mark}) should
execute successfully. This idiom appears often in code where a pointer is associated with a flag,
such as Cheney's garbage collection algorithm \cite{} and is generally considered harmless.
But violations such as buffer overflows (\cref{fig:overflow}) in which a load, store, or free would
occur outside of the proper range are undefined in PVI and must failstop. In \cref{fig:overflow},
memory is arranged so that the overflow ends up overwriting the variable {\tt y}.

%We now show separate location tags on each of the four bytes in each word. In the inputs and outputs
%of a tag rule, we write this \(\lts\), indicating that the rule consumes and produces multiple locations tags.

\Cref{fig:overflow} shows the initial state of memory on entry to {\tt overflow} and the state after
the assignment to {\tt *(x+3)}, assuming that the PC Tag is \(\PCT_0\) at the call. The tags associated
with {\tt x} (\(\PCT_1,\pt_1,\vt_1,\lts_1\)) come from \(\localtname(\PCT_0,\TN[int])\) and those
associated with {\tt y} come from \(\localtname(\PCT_1,\TN[int])\).

The write to {\tt *(x+3)} is of particular interest. We tag the result of {\tt x+3}
with \(\pt' \leftarrow \binoptname(\PCT_2, \pt_1, \constt)\); then for the store itself,
we use the rule \(\vt_4, \lts_4 \leftarrow \storetname(\PCT_2, \pt', \vt_2, \constt, \lts_2)\).

We can prevent overflows like this using a {\em memory safety} policy. In brief, whenever
an object is allocated, it is assigned a unique ``color,'' and its memory locations as well
as its pointer are tagged with that color. Pointers maintain their tags under arithmetic
operations, and loads and stores are legal if the pointer matches the target memory location.
The rules for the \(PVI\) memory safety policy are given in \cref{fig:pvi}. In this case, we will
have \(\pt_1 = \lt_1 = \tagz\) and \(\pt_2 = \lt_2 = \tagone\). When we try to write to {\tt x+3},
we compare \(\pt' = \tagz\) with \(\lt_2\), and failstop because they differ.

The cast rules, meanwhile, have no effect on the tag of the value being cast at all. So,
we can cast a pointer to a scalar value, perform any operation that is defined on that type
on it, and cast it back, and it will retain its pointer tag. As long as it ends up pointing
at the same object, loads and stores will be successful. Function pointers are an exception:
Tagged C's underlying control-flow protections prevent them from being tampered with.

\subsection{Compartmentalization}
\label{sec:comp}
% notes ended up below, in the coarse grained section
In a perfect world, all C programs would be memory safe. This world is imperfect and it is common
for a codebase to contain undefined behavior that will not be fixed. Developers intentionally use 
low-level idioms that are UB \cite{Memarian16:DeFacto}, or the cost and risk of regressions may make it
undesirable to fix bugs in older code \cite{Bessey10:Coverity}.

A compartmentalization policy can isolate potentially risky code, such as code with known UB,
from safety-critical code, and enforce the principle of least privledge. 
It limits the possible damage from exploitation to the containing compartment.
It may also restrict how code in one compartment may interact with another
even in the absence of language-level errors. Ideally, each component has only the
{\em least privilege} necessary to complete its task.
This popular defense can be implemented at many levels. It is often built
into a system's fundamental design, like a web browser sandbox untrusted javascript.
For our use-case, we consider a compartmentalization scheme being added to the system
after development and we have a set of identifiers and a map provided by 
a security engineer. The compartmetn identiifers are ranged over by \(C\), and function identifiers
are mapped to compartments by \(\mathit{comp}(f)\). 

\paragraph{Coarse-grained Protection}

% this is two tasks in the same process, all they want to do is pass scalars adn not stomp
% on each other
% then fine grained is libaries + your code, which usually need more
% than mere scalars. think libc. could foil rop gadgets? 
% mac - explicit list of allowed calls
% capability - says this is shared, protects with basic safety. anything 
%   else cannot be shared. unique colors to defeat forced pointer arthimetic. hybrid system
%   roughly the effect of containing things, but wihtout the issues of the MAC
%
The core of a compartmentalization scheme is typicall memory protection. In the simplest version, 
memory allocated by a function is only accessible by functions within its
compartment. Thus the system keeps track of the active compartment, using the PC tag.

Calls and returns each take two steps: first to an intermediate call or return state, and
then to the normal execution state, as shown in \cref{fig:functions} with some function \(f\)
calling \(f'\). In the initial call step, \(\calltname\)
uses the name-tags of the caller and callee to update the PC Tag. Then, in the step from the call
state, we place the function arguments in the temp environment, tagging their values with
the results of \(\argtname\), and we allocate our stack locals, tagging their values and locations
with the results of \(\localtname\). And on return, we deallocate locals and update their location
tags with \(\dealloctname\) when stepping to a return state, and from there \(\rettname\) updates both
the PC Tag and the tag on the returned value.

  \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{Structure of a function call}
  \label{fig:functions}
\end{figure}

In our compartmentalization policy (\cref{fig:compartments}), we define a tag to be a compartment
identifier or the default \(\N\) tag. At any given time, the PC Tag carries the compartment of the
active function, kept up to date by the \(\calltname\) and \(\rettname\) rules.

  \end{minipage}
    
  \caption{Compartmentalization Policy}
  \label{fig:compartments}
\end{figure}

The remainder of the policy works much like memory safety, except that coarse-grained
protection means that the ``color'' we assign to an allocation is the active compartment,
and during a load or store, we compare the location tags to the PC Tag, not the pointer.

\paragraph{Sharing Memory}

The above policy works if our compartments only ever communicate by passing
non-pointer values. In practice, this is far too restrictive! Many library functions 
take pointers and operate on memory shared with the caller. External libraries are
effectively required for most software to function yet represent a threat. Isolating 
external libraries from critical code prevents vulnerabilities in the library from 
compromising critical code and deprives potential attackers of ROP gadgets and other
tools if there is an exploit in the critical code.

To allow intentional sharing of memory across compartments, a more flexible policy is needed. 
Suppose for example the hostname needs to conform to an expected pattern, 
such as in an enterprise network, to differentiate between different classes of
computers (employee, server, contractor, etc). The standard library, 
over in its own compartment, has helpful functions, 
provided the caller provides the buffers from which to set or get the hostname. 

\begin{verbatim}
  void configure_enterprise(char* intended_name) {
    int ret = 0;
    char* curr_name = malloc(HOST_NAME_MAX + 1);
    ret = gethostname( &curr_name, HOST_NAME_MAX + 1 );
    if (! ret && !(strcmp(curr_name, intended_name))) {
      ret = sethostname(intended_name), strlen(intended_name);
      ....
    }
    ....
  }
\end{verbatim}

The literature contains two main approaches to this problem:
{\em mandatory access control} and {\em capabilities}. The former explicitly
enumerates the access rights of each compartment, while the latter turns passed
pointers into unforgeable tokens of privilege, so that the act of passing one
implicitly grants the recipient access.

Tagged C can enforce either; here we will demonstrate a capability approach
in which we delineate allocations that may be passed and those that must not.
At the syntactic level we separate these by creating a variant identifier for {\tt malloc},
{\tt malloc\_share}. This identifier maps to the same address (i.e., it is still calling the same function)
but its name tag differs and can therefore parameterize the tag rule. The source
must have the malloc name changed for every allocation that might be shared.
The annotation could be performed manually, or perhaps automatically using some form
of escape analysis.

Seen in \cref{fig:sharing}, the policy works by gluing compartmentalization and memory safety
together. The PC Tag carries the current compartment and the next color for shared allocations,
and \(\malloctname\) uses the function tag to determine which to attach to the pointer and allocated
region. During loads and stores, the location tag of the target address
determines whether access is restricted via the identity of the active compartment or
the validity of the pointer.

%\paragraph{Mandatory Access Control}

%Mandatory access control works by associating objects in memory with the compartments that
%are allowed to access them. 

%Mandatory access control requires the policy designer to identity every pair of object
%and compartment that it will be shared with. This may require too much analysis if
%objects are shared widely throughout the system. Conversely, it does not
%distinguish between accesses via a valid pointer and those that are the result of
%UB.

%If a compartment can obtain a shared pointer, we assume that it is allowed to access the associated
%memory. But the access must be performed using that pointer, ruling out other methods such as pointer
%forging.

%[TODO: PNVI needs a lot more motivation, especially given that the security benefits are

%In PNVI, by contrast, an integer cast to a pointer gains the provenance of the object it points
%to when the cast occurs. While PNVI supports a wider range of programs, it is inconsistent with important
%assumptions of the C memory model, in ways that may have serious security consequences.
%The difference between PVI and PNVI is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PVI-PNVI}.

%We will aim to prove that for any program, if it is run in both the PVI semantics

%undefined in the PVI semantics and failstops in Tagged C. Likewise for PNVI, except that
%some UB in PNVI is non-deterministic, and we only require that it failstop in an execution
%that would {\it reach} the UB.

%In PNVI, the basic provenance model remains the same as PVI, so we can reuse most of the
%same rules. The primary difference is what happens when we cast a pointer to an integer.
%In PVI, tags are propagated as normal.
%To support PNVI, we need the {\it cast} expression to update the tags of a pointer
%being cast to an integer and vice versa. We add two special-case steps to reflect this.

%\paragraph{Realizing the Integer-Pointer Cast}

\subsection{Secure Information Flow}
\label{sec:SIF}

Our final example policy will be a more realistic version of our first:
{\em secure information flow (SIF)}. SIF is described in the venerable Denning and Denning
\cite{Denning77:SecureInformationFlow}, and part of a larger family of policies
known as {\em information flow control} (IFC.) This family of policies deal entirely with enforcing
higher-level security concerns, regardless of whether the code that they protect contains
errors or undefined behaviors. We will give an example of a single policy in the family.
Our introductory example was an instance of {\em confidentiality}, so now we will discuss
{\em integrity}: preventing insecure input from influencing secure behavior.
In this code, a malformed user input is accidentally appended to an sql query without sanitization:

\begin{verbatim}
void sanitize(char* in, char* out);
char* sql_query(char* query);

void get_data() {
  char[20] name;
  char[20] name_san;
  char[100] query = "select address where name =";

  scanf("%19f", name);
  sanitize(name, name_san);
  strncat(query, name, strlen(name));
  
  sprintf(buf, sql_query(query));
  return;
}
\end{verbatim}

This function sanitizes its input {\tt name}, then appends the result to an appropriate SQL
query, storing the result in {\tt buf}. But, in the default case, the programmer has accidentally
used the unsanitized string! This creates the opportunity for an SQL injection attack: a caller
to this function could (presumably at the behest of an outside user) call it with {\tt field} of
3 and {\tt name} of ``Bobby; drop table;''.

The fact that the input can be sanitized also makes this an {\em intransitive} policy:
information may flow from {\tt scanf} to {\tt sanitize}, and from {\tt sanitize} to
{\tt sql\_query}, but not directly from {\tt scanf} to {\tt sql\_query}.

\label{fig:sif1}
\end{figure}

Since we care about a single source, we can once again use the standard division of \(\high\)
and \(\low\). We additionally need to carry significant information on the PC Tag. First, we
track the current function identifier. Beyond that, we need two pieces of information to deal
with {\em implicit flows}, situations where the control-flow of the program is influenced by a secret.
In our initial example we simplified these. To keep track of tainted scopes, the
PC Tag carries a list of booleans, \(e\), and a set of label identifiers, \(L\).
We will discuss these in detail below. Initially, the PC Tag is \(\pctaint{f}{\varepsilon}{\emptyset}\),
and all values and memory locations are tagged \(\low\).

The detailed tag rules for expressions are given in \cref{fig:sif1}. We define two operators on tags:
the ``join'' operator \(\sqcup\) takes the higher of two security levels, and the ``reduce''
operator \(| \cdot |\) converts a PC Tag into a security level, \(\high\) or \(\low\).
The function {\tt scanf} taints all of its writes by marking them \(\high\). This extends to
its return value in \(\rettname\) as well (not shown.) By the same token, all outputs of
{\tt sanitize} are tagged \(\low\), so that when it copies \(\high\)-tagged data into its
output buffer, we consider those data safe.

In this scenario, our policy aims to prevent {\tt sql\_query} from recieving tainted data.
For this reason, we failstop if {\tt sql\_query} would load a tainted value.

Things become trickier when we consider that the program's control-flow itself can be tainted.
This can occur in any conditional, including loops, conditional statements, and conditional expressions.
In general, anytime a ``split'' is conditioned on a tainted value, subsequent assignments must also be tainted.
An example can be seen in \cref{fig:ifthenelse}, where labels in the code indicate the split
point, branches, and {\em join point} \(J\).

A join point is the node in the program's control-flow graph where all possible routes
from the split to a return have re-converged; its its immediate post-dominator \cite{}.
[TODO: this is the Denning cited in Bay and Askarov] At this point, an observer can no
longer deduce which path execution took, except through the assignments that happened
in \(b_1\) or \(b_2\), which are already tainted. It is therefore safe to tag future
assignments \(\low\). In the example, {\tt public1} should be tagged \(\high\), while
{\tt public2} is tagged \(\low\).

We assume a {\em termination-insensitive} setting \cite{Askarov08:TINILeaks}, in which
we allow an observer to glean information by the termination or non-termination of
the program. This is a necessary limitation of an enforcement mechanism that halts
execution. Having accepted this limitation, we may apply the same analysis to loops
as well as conditionals.

\Cref{fig:SIFconditionals} gives the tag rules for handling conditionals and loops.
All branching statements are governed by the same \(\splittname\) rule, and their join points
by the \(\labeltname\) rule when the label is placed on a join point. Branching expressions
are likewise handled by the \(\exprsplittname\) rule, and the \(\exprjointname\) rule.
This last needs no label, due to the predictable structure of nested expressions.

Of course, code does not generally come with labeled join points, and they must be associated
with their split points. We introduce additional forms of the if, while, do-while, for, and switch
statements which carry an additional label, and perform some preprocessing to associate these
with new labels in the source code. This preprocessing step generates the program's
control flow graph and, for each branch, identifies its immediate post-dominator. That
node is labeled with  a fresh identifier, and the same identifier is added to the original
conditional statement.

\section{Implementing Tagged C with PIPE}
\label{sec:optionals}

Chhak et al. \cite{Chhak21:Tagine} introduce a verified compiler from a toy
high-level language with tags
to a control-flow-graph-based intermediate representation of a PIPE-based
ISA. It is a proof-of-concept of compilation from a source language's tag policy to
realistic hardware. Everything in a PIPE system carries tags, including instructions. 
Instruction tags are statically determined at compile-time, so they can carry data about source-level
control points in the corresponding assembly. This means that PIPE can emulate any given Tagged C
policy by running two policies in parallel: a basic stack-and-function-pointer-safety policy to mimic Tagged C's
high-level control-flow, and the source-level policy as written.

Chhak et al.'s general strategy for mapping Tagged C's tag rules sometimes requires adding extra
instructions to the generated code. A Tagged-C control point
may require a tag from a location that is not read under a normal compilation scheme, or must update tags
in locations that would otherwise not be written. Such instructions are unnecessary overhead if the policy
doesn't meaningfully use the relevant tags.

To mitigate this, control points whose compilation would add potentially extraneous instructions
take optional parameters or return optional results. We will explain how the rule should be
implemented in the target if the options are used.
\sna{I think we have been leaning toward doing so in more detail here, not threaded through the
  rest of the paper. So that's a TODO.}
Optional inputs and outputs are marked with boxes. If a policy does not make use of the options, it will
be sound to compile without the extra instructions.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Tagged C aims to combine the flexibility of tag-based architectures with the abstraction
of a high-level language. How well have we achieved this aim?

[Here we list criteria and evaluate how we fulfilled them]

\begin{itemize}
\item Flexibility: we demonstrate three policies that can be used alone or in conjunction
\item Applicability: we support the full complement of C language features and give definition
  to many undefined C programs
\item Practical security: our example security policies are based on important security concepts
  from the literature
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Limitations}

By committing to a tag-based mechanism, we do restrict the space of policies that Tagged C
can enforce. In general, a reference monitor can enforce any policy that constitutes a
{\em safety property}---any policy whose violation can be demonstrated by a single finite
trace. This class includes such policies as ``no integer overflow'' and ``pointers are always in-bounds,''
which depend on the values of variables. Tag-based monitors cannot enforce any policy that
depends on the value of a variable rather than its tags.

Due to our approach to tagging memory uniformly at allocation time, Tagged C cannot easily
enforce substructural memory safety. Versions of memory safety that protect fields of a
struct from overflows within the same struct would be very useful, but currently enforcing
them will require manual initialization.

\subsection{Unknown Limitations}

[TODO]

\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Reference Monitors}

The concept of a reference monitor was first introduced fifty years ago in \cite{Anderson72:PlanningStudy}:
a tamper-proof and verifiable subsystem that checks every security-relevant operation in a system to
ensure that it conforms to a security {\em policy} (a general specification of acceptable behavior;
see \cite{Goguen82:SecurityPolicies}.)

A reference monitor can be implemented at any level of a system. An {\em inline reference monitor}
is a purely compiler-based system that inserts checks at appropriate places in the code.
Alternatively, a reference monitor might be embedded in the operating system, or in an interpreted
language's runtime. A {\em hardware reference monitor} instead provides primitives at the ISA-level
that accelerate security and make it harder to subvert.

Programmable Interlocks for Policy Enforcement (PIPE) \cite{Dhawan14:PUMP} is a hardware extension
that uses {\em metadata tagging}. Each register and each word of memory is associated with
an additional array of bits called a tag. The policy is decomposed into a set of {\em tag rules}
that act in parallel with each executing instruction, using the tags on its operands to
decide whether the instruction is legal and, if so, determine which tags to place on its results.
PIPE tags are large relative to other tag-based hardware, giving it the flexibility
to implement complex policies with structured tags, and even run multiple policies at once.

Other hardware monitors include Arm MTE, [Binghamton], and CHERI.
Arm MTE aims to enforce a narrow form of memory safety using 4-bit tags, which distinguish adjacent objects
in memory from one another, preventing buffer overflows, but not necessarily other memory violations.
[TODO: read the Binghamton paper, figure out where they sit here.] 

CHERI is capability machine [TODO: cite OG CHERI]. In CHERI, capabilities
are ``fat pointers'' carrying extra bounds and permission information, and capability-protected
memory can only be accessed via a capability with the appropriate privilege. This is a natural
way to enforce spatial memory safety, and techniques have been demonstrated for enforcing
temporal safety \cite{NWF20:Cornucopia}, stack safety \cite{Skorstengaard19:stktokens},
and compartmentalization [TODO: figure out what to cite], with varying degrees of ease and
efficiency. But CHERI cannot easily enforce notions of security based on dataflow,
such as Secure Information Flow.

In this paper, we describe a programming language with an abstract reference monitor.
We realize it as an interpreter with the reference monitor built in, and envision
eventually compiling to PIPE-equipped hardware. An inlining compiler would also be plausible.
As a result of this choice, our abstract reference monitor uses a PIPE-esque notion of
tags.

\paragraph{Aspect Oriented Programming}

[TODO: do forward search from original AOP paper]

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

We have presented the language and a reference interpreter, built on top of the CompCert interpreter
\cite{Leroy09:CompCert}, and three example policies. There are several significant next-steps.

\paragraph{Compilation}

An interpreter is all well and good, but a compiler would be preferable for many reasons.
A compiled Tagged C could use the hardware acceleration of a PIPE target, and could more easily
support linked libraries, including linking against code written in other languages.
The ultimate goal would be a fully verified compiler, but that is a very long way off.

\paragraph{Language Proofs}

There are a couple of properties of the language semantics itself that we would like to prove.
Namely (1) that its behavior (prior to adding a policy) matches that of CompCert C and
(2) that the behavior of a given program is invariant under all policies up to truncation due
to failstop.

\paragraph{Policy Correctness Proofs}

For each example policy discussed in this paper, we sketched a formal specification for the
security property it ought to enforce. A natural continuation would be to prove the correctness
of each policy against these specifications.

\paragraph{Policy DSL}

Currently, policies are written in Gallina, the language embedded in Coq. This is fine for a
proof-of-concept, but not satisfactory for real use. We plan to develop a domain-specific policy
language to make it easier to write Tagged C policies.

\section{Initial State}

Given a list \(xs\) of variable identifiers \(id\) and types
\(ty\), a program's initial memory is defined by iteratively allocating each one
in memory and updating the global environment with its base address, bound, type,
and a static identity tag. Let \(|ty|\) be a function from types to their sizes
in bytes. The memory is initialized \(\vundef@\vt@\overline{\lt}\)
for some \(\vt\) and \(\overline{\lt}\), unless given an initializer.
Let \(\mem_0\) and \(\genv_0\) be the initial (empty) memory and environment.
The parameter \(b\) marks the start of the global region.

%Since we don't need to initialize tags in memory dynamically, our rule for
%selecting these tags can cover the entire initialization of the memory with arbitrary
%granularity. We represent this as a list of tags of length \(|ty|\).

\[\mathit{globals} ~ xs ~ b =
\begin{cases}
  (\mem_0, \genv_0) & \textnormal{if } xs = \varepsilon \\
  (\mem[p \dots p+|ty| \mapsto \vundef@\vt@\overline{\lt}]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } xs = (id,ty)::xs' \\
  ~ \genv[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) & \textnormal{and } \trule{\globaltres}{\globalt} \\
  & \textnormal{where } (\mem,\genv) = \mathit{globals} ~ xs' ~ (b + |ty|) \\

\subsection{Contexts}
\label{app:contexts}

Our expression semantics are contextual. A context \(\mathit{ctx}\) is a function from an
expression to an expression and a tag. We identify a valid context using the \(\mathit{context}\)
relation over a ``kind'' (left-hand or right-hand, \(\lh\) or \(\rh\)),
and an expression.

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathit{context} & ~ k ~ \ctx{\expr} ::= \\

\end{aligned}\]

Next, we define a notion of expression reduction. A left-hand reduction relates an expression to an expression.
A right-hand reduction relates a triple of PC Tag, memory, and expression to another such triple.

%triple of a memory, an expression, and a tag
%might reduces to another such triple as a left-hand, right-hand, or call reduction, written
%\((\mem, \expr, \PCT) \Rightarrow_k (\mem', \expr', \PCT')\),
%based on rules given below. These reductions are embedded in states as follows.

\judgmenttwo{\(\mathit{context} ~ \lh ~ \ctx{\expr}\)}
            {\(\expr \Rightarrow_\lh \expr'\)}
            {\(\defestate{\ctx{\expr}} \longrightarrow \defestate{\ctx{\expr}}\)}

\judgmenttwo{\(\mathit{context} ~ \rh ~ \ctx{\expr}\)}
            {\((\PCT, \mem, \expr) \Rightarrow_\rh (\PCT', \mem', \expr')\)}
            {\(\defestate{\ctx{\expr}} \longrightarrow \estate{\PCT'}{\mem'}{\ctx{\expr}}{\cont}\)}

\subsection{Call and Return Rules}

In order to make a call, we need to reduce the function expression to an \(\floc{\_}\) value, an
abstract location corresponding to a particular function. Then we can make the call.

\callexprstep

When we make an internal call, we need to allocated space for locals and arguments using the helper function
\(\mathit{frame}\).

\[\mathit{frame} ~ xs ~ as ~ \mem =
\begin{cases}
  (\mem''[p \mapsto \vundef@\vt@\overline{\lt}]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } xs = (id,ty)::xs' \\
  \lenv'[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) &
  \textnormal{where } (\mem',p) \leftarrow \mathit{stack\_alloc} ~ |ty| ~ \mem, \\
  & \trule{\localtres}{\localt}, \\
  & \textnormal{and } (\mem'',\lenv') = \mathit{frame} ~ xs' ~ as ~ m' \\ 
  \\
  (\mem''[p \mapsto v@\vt'@\overline{\lt}]_{|ty|}, & \textnormal{if } as = (id,ty,v @ \vt)::as' \textnormal{ and } xs = \varepsilon \\
  \lenv'[id \mapsto (\mathit{p, p+|ty|,ty,\pt})]) &
  \textnormal{where } (\mem',p) \leftarrow \mathit{stack\_alloc} ~ |ty| ~ \mem, \\
  & \trule{\argtres}{\argt}, \\
  & \textnormal{and } (\mem'',\lenv') = \mathit{frame} ~ xs' ~ as ~ m' \\
  \\
  (\mem, \lambda x . \bot) & \textnormal{if } xs = \varepsilon \textnormal{ and } as = \varepsilon \\
\end{cases}\]

\callstep

On the other hand, when we make an external call, we step directly to a return state with some value
being returned and an updated memory. [TODO: talk more about how the tag policy applies in external
  functions, what they can and can't do with tags.]

\extcallstep

Special external functions, such as malloc, just get their own rules.

\mallocstep

And finally, we have the return rules.

\section{Moved from Intro}

\sna{I'm organizing our diss tracks into paragraphs that we can cut or move as needed}
\paragraph*{Why Dynamic?}
  
  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to fully secure C code before run-time.
  Ideally, bugs would be quickly identified and then fixed promptly. 
  That is not always possible for a variety of reasons: bugs may escape detection, 
  require significant effort to diagnose, or be impractical to fix. 
  There are many techniques for finding bugs, but there is a shared stumbling block: C is not 
  well defined. We cannot always agree on when something is a bug in C, especially code using
   Undefined Behaviors (UB) \cite{defactoC}. Confusion around expected behavior is no small problem. 
  There are 191 undefined behaviors and 52 unspecified behaviors in the C99 
  specification \cite{Csmith}. Sometimes these behaviors are benign and skillfully 
  used by the developer, other times they are unintended and highly dangerous. 
  Unfortunately the distinction between the two is easily lost. 
  Discerning expert code review is considered best practice, although it is 
  rarely perfectly successful \cite{} % https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-36563-8_14 }
  even if an expert is available at all. Even when there is both consensus 
  and detection of a bug\apt{??} \amn{we can find it at and we can agree its a problem that should be fixed}, 
  changing the code may not be possible because  
  it is in proprietary 3rd party libraries and drivers, or because
  regulations prohibit changes \cite{Bessey10:Coverity}.

  \apt{last clause is mysterious} \amn {
    for example FDA approval used to forbid patching because you'd have to go through recertification. 
    So healthcare wouldn't patch. SNA pointed out the coverity paper comments on this as a reason for 
    bugs not getting fixed}

  \paragraph*{Why C-Level?}
  Tag-based enforcement in general has a significant body of work at the assembly level, especially
  PIPE (Programmable Interlocks for Policy Enforcement) \cite{}. However, even at the assembly-level
  these systems need the compiler to be in the trusted computing base (TCB), as many policies require
  knowledge of source-level constructs, even ones that do not depend on detailed knowledge of the program's
  behavior [cite Nick and Andre; anyone else?]. Moving policy-definition to the source level therefore
  does not expand the TCB and allows C developers to reason about policies in terms of the language that
  they program in regularly.

  \paragraph*{Notations}
  Values are ranged over by \(v\), variable identifiers by \(x\), and function identifiers by \(f\).
Tags use a number of metavariables: \(t\) ranges over all tags, while we will use
\(\vt\) to refer to the tags associated with values, \(\pt\) for tags on pointer values
and memory-location expressions, \(\lt\) for tags associated with memory locations themselves,
\(\nt\) for ``name tags'' automatically derived from identifiers, \(\PCT\) for the
global ``program counter tag'' or PC Tag.
An {\it atom} is a pair of a value and a tag, \(\val{v}{\vt}\); the @ symbol should be read
as a pair in general, and is used when the second object in the pair is a tag.
Expressions are ranged over by \(\expr\), statements by \(\stmt\), and continuations by \(\cont\).
The continuations are defined in \cref{app:continuations}, and step rules in \cref{app:rules}.

A memory is an array of bytes, where each byte is part of an atom.
Each byte is also associated with a ``location tag'' \(\lt\). When a contiguous region of \(s\) bytes
starting at location \(l\) comprise an atom \(v@\vt\), and their locations tags comprise the list \(\lts\),
we write \(\mem[l]_s = v@\vt @\lts\). Likewise, \(\mem[l \dots l + s \mapsto v@\vt @ \lts]_s\)
denotes storing that many bytes. Visually, we will represent whole atoms in memory as condensed boxes,
with their location tags separate.
