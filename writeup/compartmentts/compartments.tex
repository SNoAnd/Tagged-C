\begin{abstract}

  C code can be challenging to secure due to the prevalence of undefined behavior (UB),
  especially UB related to memory. Using an enforcement system like Tagged C, it is
  straightforward to enforce a memory safety security policy that eliminates all memory
  UB, and this is desirable as they can be major vulnerabilities. But some UB may
  also be supported by common compilers and used by programmers in the wild---the
  ``defacto standard''---and fully protecting all memory objects is expensive.
  The solution: compartmentalization.

  We present a compartmentalization policy that allows some compartments to treat
  memory concretely, enabling the full array of low-level pointer-manipulating idioms
  internally while isolating any errors that arise from such idioms inside the compartment. 
  We prove that under this policy, standard-compliant compartments are protected from
  other compartments that they link with. Conversely, we conjecture that even compartments
  containing memory UB are protect, albeit in a more limited sense, and we
  give a formalization of the nature of this protection.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Why Memory Safety?}

\subsection{Why Not Memory Safety?}

\paragraph{Low-level Idioms}

The first reason not to enforce full memory safety is that code found in the wild may
be memory unsafe in ways that are harmless or even intentional. These ``low-level idioms''
exploit the underlying structure of pointers as integers. In particular, we are interested
in those idioms that create a new pointer to an existing object, either from scratch
(pointer-forging) or by performing arithmetic on a pointer to a different object. Errors
involving these idioms can very easily result in loads and stores to and from the wrong
object, creating serious vulnerabilities. And these idioms are used in practice: for example,
the Linux kernel's per-CPU-variable library maintains a table of offsets that are added to a
base pointer to find one of several separately-allocated objects in memory.

\begin{verbatim}
#define per_cpu_ptr(ptr, cpu) ({ RELOC_HIDE(ptr, __per_cpu_offset[cpu]); })
// RELOC_HIDE computes ptr + offset while hiding from the compiler
\end{verbatim}

It is also common for low-level code to directly access pre-defined addresses that play
some specialized role, such as interfacing with an external piece of hardware.
[TODO: example]

In each of these scenarios, a full memory-safety policy will fail on a normal (safe)
execution! So, we need a policy that can be permissive enough to allow low-level idioms,
but which mitigates their risks by constraining the relevant code to isolated, untrusted compartments.

\paragraph{Performance}

The second reason not to enforce full memory safety is that doing so is likely to be expensive.
The details vary depending on the hardware, but in practice Tagged C policies will likely be
limited to a finite number of ``live'' tags at any given time. In memory-safety policies,
this will be correlated to the number of live objects at any given time, but by relaxing the
policies, we can reduce it. Our smallest policy uses a number of tags that is linear in
the number of live objects that are shared across compartment boundaries.

\subsection{Tagged C and Concrete C}

Here we give a brief overview of Tagged C, discuss its baseline protections, and confirm that
in the absence of other policies it can support all of the low-level idioms discussed above.
This is a good place to plug Concrete C as an independent concept that is useful.

\subsection{Contributions}

Our contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A compartmentalization policy that separates a program into mutually distrustful
  components, which may be ``rigid'' (memory safety is enforced internally) or ``lax''
  (permitted to treat memory fully concretely).
\item A pen-and-paper proof that the compartmentalized system preserves the security of a
  safe component from an unsafe one, formalized as a robust safety preservation property.
\item A novel security property, [TODO: give it a name] characterizing the protection offered
  to an unsafe component, formalized in terms of a simplified version of Tagged C. We conjecture
  that our compartmentalization policy enforces [NAME] as well.
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples}

For our examples we're interested in exploring the interaction between a compartment that uses
cross-object pointer arithmetic and one that does not (but which has interesting interplay.)
In all examples we will establish that {\tt f} is in the compartment {\tt A}, and {\tt g} is in
compartment {\tt B}. We put {\tt main} in the opposite compartment from the function
that it's going to call.

In Figure \ref{fig:isoexample1}, {\tt B} contains a pretty ordinary off-by-one error
that overflows {\tt a}. It is a rigid compartment, so it should failstop rather than
violate memory safety in this way. Meanwhile, {\tt A} performs inter-object pointer
arithmetic, which we do want to allow. Figure \ref{fig:isoexample1} goes on to give a possible
trace (see Section \ref{sec:traces}) of execution of this program, with markings indicating
where it failstops under a full memory safety policy ({\color{red} \sc ms}), our non-sharing
compartmentalization policy ({\color{red} \sc noshare}), and our policy extended with
sharing ({\color{red} \sc share}).

%{\tt f} allocates {\tt x} and {\tt y}, and computes an
%offset between them. Then it uses that offset to turn a pointer to {\tt x} into one to
%{\tt y}, and write through it. After a call to {\tt g}, it returns {\tt y[0]}, which
%should be 42. But, {\tt g} performs its own out of bounds store. Suppose {\tt x} is
%allocated at {\tt 0xAB00}, {\tt y} at {\tt 0xAB20}, and {\tt z} at {\tt 0xAB40}.
%Then {\tt g} will overwritte {\tt y[0]}!

Meanwhile, in Figure \ref{fig:sharingexample}, {\tt f} takes the offset between
{\tt x} and {\tt y} and adds it to the pointer to {\tt x} to produce a pointer to {\tt y}.
Then it passes {\tt x} and the offset to {\tt g}, which assumes that it is passed an array
and an in-bounds offset into it, and returns the value at that offset. The crux of the issue
is that compartment {\tt A} can, perhaps, be trusted to do this kind of arithmetic with its
own pointers, but we would not want compartment {\tt B} to be able to access arbitrary objects
in compartment {\tt A} just by doing some pointer arithmetic.

\section{Separating Rigid and Lax Compartments}

As a first step toward our ultimate goal, let's think about a simpler kind of protection:
separating the world into rigid and lax compartments that do not share memory.

\subsection{Policy In Detail}

A Tagged C policy consists of a tag type \(\tau\), a {\it policy state} type \(\sigma\),
and instantiations of a set of {\it tag rules}, each of which parameterizes the behavior
of key {\it control points} in the semantics. Tag rules are written in a procedural style,
assigning tags to their outputs by name. The state \(s : \sigma\) can always be accessed
and assigned to.
\sna{This is going to be a real pain to explain so that it can be followed without
  reading the last paper.}

\paragraph{Relevant Policy Rules}

Without further ado, let's define our policy. Tags consist of compartment identifiers
\(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) and per-compartment allocation colors \(\mathbf{clr}(C,a)\), where
\(a\) is a natural number. The policy state is a counter that tracks the next allocation color.
\[\tau ::= \mathbf{comp}(C) | \mathbf{clr}(C,a) | \emptyset \]
\[\sigma := \mathbb{N} \]
We assume a mapping \(owner\) from function and global identifiers to compartments,
and initialize tags such that the function pointer tag for each function \(f\) is \(owner(f)\).
The trusted compartment set \(\mathit{rigid} ~ C\) contains all of the compartments that
we wish to enforce memory safety within. We start by keeping track of which compartment we're in.

\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
  \calltruleblock{\(\PCT['] := pt\)}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
  \rettruleblock{\(\PCT['] := \PCT[_{CLR}]\)}
\end{minipage}

The memory locations of global variables are tagged with the compartment that owns them.
Dynamic memory is more complicated. We first check whether the active compartment is rigid.
If it is lax, the allocated memory is tagged with the compartment identity only. But if it is
rigid, both the pointer and the memory location are tagged with the owning compartment and
a fresh allocation color. Once we have a color attached to a pointer, it is propagated along
with the pointer, including through any arithmetic operations provided that the other operand
is not tagged as a pointer.

\hspace{-5em}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
  \localtruleblock{
    let \(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) := \(\PCT\) in \\
    \(\vt['] := \emptyset;\) \\
    if \(\mathit{safe} ~ C\) \\
    then \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \mathbf{clr}(C,s);\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \mathbf{clr}(C,s);\) \\
      \(s := s+1\)
    \end{tabular} \\
    else \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
    \end{tabular} \\
  }
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
  \malloctruleblock{
    let \(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) := \(\PCT\) in \\
    \(\vt['] := \emptyset;\) \\
    if \(\mathit{safe} ~ C\) \\
    then \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \mathbf{clr}(C,s);\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \mathbf{clr}(C,s);\) \\
      \(s := s+1\)
    \end{tabular} \\
    else \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
    \end{tabular} \\
  }
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.29\textwidth}
  \globaltruleblock{\(\vt['] := \emptyset;\) \\ \(\lt['] := owner(\mathtt{x})\)}

  \binoptruleblock{
    \caseofthree{\(\vt[_1], \vt[_2]\)}
                {\(\mathbf{clr}(C,a),\emptyset\) \\ \(\emptyset, \mathbf{clr}(C,a)\)}{\(\mathbf{clr}(C,a)\)}
                {\(\emptyset,\emptyset\)}{\(\emptyset\)}
                {\(\underline{~~}, \underline{~~}\)}{\(\fail\)}
  }
\end{minipage}

Like allocations, loads and stores have different behavior depending on whether or not the active
compartment is rigid or lax. In a lax compartment, it merely compares the PC tag to the location
tag of the target address. In a rigid compartment, it also checks that the pointer color matches
that of the target address.

\hspace{-5em}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
  \loadtruleblock{
    let \(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) := \(\PCT\) in \\
    if \(\mathit{rigid} ~ C\) \\
    then \(\mathbf{assert} ~ \lt = \mathbf{comp}(C)\) \\
    \(\vt['] := \vt\) \\
    else \(\mathbf{assert} ~ \exists a . \pt = \mathbf{clr}(C,a) \land \lt = \mathbf{clr}(C,a)\) \\
    \(\vt['] := \vt\) \\
  }
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.44\textwidth}
  \storetruleblock{
    let \(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) := \(\PCT\) in \\
    if \(\mathit{rigid} ~ C\) \\
    then \(\mathbf{assert} ~ \lt = \mathbf{comp}(C)\) \\
    \(\PCT['] := \PCT; \vt['] := \vt; \lt['] := \lt\) \\
    else \(\mathbf{assert} ~ \exists a . \pt = \mathbf{clr}(C,a) \land \lt = \mathbf{clr}(C,a)\) \\
    \(\PCT['] := \PCT; \vt['] := \vt; \lt['] := \lt\) \\
  }
\end{minipage}

Note that this policy allows pointers to be passed between compartments, but they can only
be accessed by the compartment that allocated them. This is a simplification to introduce
the structure of the safety properties, and we will relax it later.

When we deallocate any object, we clear its location tags, so old floating pointers
can no longer read or write to it.

\subsection{Proving Protection}

%\paragraph{Setting and Attacker Model}

%Our proofs are phrased in terms of a program with two compartments: a rigid compartment
%that is protected, and a lax one that may be compromised. The lax
%component may contain arbitrary C code, including code with undefined behavior, representing
%the worst-case scenario for a compromised component.

\paragraph{Trace Examples}

Before we define our property formally, let's 

\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.42\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
A >> int f() {
  int *x = malloc(sizeof(int));
  *x = 42;
  return g(x);
}
\end{verbatim}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
B >> int g(int *p) {
  int y = 5;
  return *p + y;
}
\end{verbatim}

  return f();

  g(x,6);
  return y[0];

\end{verbatim}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
B >> void g(int *p, int i) {
  p[i] = 5;
  return;
}
\end{verbatim}
    \end{minipage}
  
    \[A[B] \rightsquigarrow_\bot \mathit{call} ~ f ~ []; \mathit{call} ~ g ~ [(\phi_0, \mathtt{0xBEEF})];
    \mathit{load} ~ (\phi_0, \mathtt{0xABCD}) ~ 42; \mathit{return} ~ 47; \mathit{return} ~ 47\]
  \end{subfigure}
  
  \caption{Example of compartments and their traces}
  \label{fig:trexample}
\end{figure}

[Give a couple of examples of programs and the traces they produce.]
If we apply a memory safety policy to each of these examples, we get [new, truncated traces]. 
Informally, we can get a sense of certain kinds of interactions that we just eliminated.
[Example] very clearly violated the array abstraction \sna{Is that the right term?} by
causing the code to read a different value from [address] than it wrote; with memory safety
we the trace is truncated before that violation. In [example], [pointer] is never passed outside
[compartment], yet it is written to by [compartment]; likewise, memory safety prevents this.

We do not need to define these conditions formally, because they are implicitly enforced by
the memory safety policy. Instead, we take memory safety as a reference point and define safe
compartmentalization in terms of preserving all of these implicit properties.

\paragraph{Events and Traces}

For both of our examples, we will give a trace of how
it behaves under each variation of the compartmentalization policy. In order to do that, we
need to define a system of traces.

Compartments interact via calls and returns, and via visible loads and stores. A load or a store
is visible if it is made via a valid pointer. To each allocation we associate a provenance
symbol \(\phi\), and we track the provenance of every pointer within each compartment.
Then, when a load or store is performed by a pointer of provenance \(\phi\), we record both
\(\phi\) and the concrete address of the target object in the trace.

Formally, an event value is a value with an optional provenance. An event is a call, return,
alloc, free, load, or store. An alloc records the range of addresses that are allocated and
gives them a unique provenance. A load or a store always records the provenance of the pointer
being accessed (which means that it needs to be a valid pointer so as to have a provenance);
a load or store with no provenance is not visible in the trace. It also gives the range of
addresses affected.

\[ev ::= v | (\phi, v)\]
\[\begin{split}
e ::= & \mathit{call} ~ f ~ \overline{ev} \\
| & \mathit{return} ~ ev \\
| & \mathit{alloc} ~ \phi ~ a_0 \dots a_n \\
| & \mathit{free} ~ \phi \\
| & \mathit{load} ~ \phi ~ a_0 \dots a_n ~ ev \\
| & \mathit{store} ~ \phi ~ a_0 \dots a_n ~ ev \\
\end{split}\]

A trace is a (possibly infinite) sequence of event values.

Let \(A\) and \(B\) be components such that linking them produces a complete program.
We write the linked program \(A[B]\), and when such a program run under tag
policy \(\rho\) produces a trace \(t\), we write \(A[B] \rightsquigarrow_\rho t\).
We represent the ``baseline'' policy, which never failstops, with \(\bot\).

\paragraph{Robust Safety Preservation}

This brings us to the definition of {\em robust safety preservation}. First, we define the
class of {\em safety properties} as those properties \(\pi\) which can always be falsified by
a finite prefix of a trace. Now, for any compartment ``under focus'', \(C\), consider the set
of safety properties {\em robustly satisfied} by \(C\) under some policy \(\rho\):

\[\overline{\pi}(C)_\rho \triangleq \{ \pi \mid \forall A ~ t .
C[A] \rightsquigarrow_\rho t \rightarrow t \in \pi \}\]

For any pair of policies \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\), we say that \(\rho'\) enjoys robust
safety preservation with respect to \(\rho\) if, for all \(C\),
\(\overline{\pi}(C)_\rho \subseteq \overline{\pi}(C)_{\rho'}\).

\subsection{Proof}

\section{Safely Sharing Memory}

Now we extend the policy above to allow sharing memory. The crucial difference is that
safe pointers are no longer tied to particular compartments; instead, we distinguish
between {\it allocation points}---that is, calls to malloc, grouped according to
whether or not the allocated object should be shared between compartments.
So, we add another tag, \(\mathbf{share}\), which is attached to the function pointer
of each call to malloc that is meant to be shared.

\[\tau ::= \mathbf{comp}(C) | \mathbf{clr}(a) | \emptyset | \mathbf{share} \]

For simplicity, we focus exclusively on malloc and disallow sharing of stack pointers;
these are therefore tagged with \(\mathbf{comp}\) for every compartment. The malloc rule
checks the tag on the function pointer being called to determine how to proceed.

\hspace{-5em}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
  \localtruleblock{
    let \(\mathbf{comp}(C)\) := \(\PCT\) in \\
    \(\vt['] := \emptyset;\) \\
    \(\pt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
    \(\lt['] := \mathbf{comp}(C);\) \\
    }
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
  \malloctruleblock{
    \(\vt['] := \emptyset;\) \\
    if \(\pt = \mathbf{share}\) \\
    then \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \mathbf{clr}(s);\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \mathbf{clr}(s);\) \\
      \(s := s+1\)
    \end{tabular} \\
    else \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
      \(\pt['] := \PCT;\) \\
      \(\lt['] := \PCT;\) \\
    \end{tabular}
  }
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.29\textwidth}
  \binoptruleblock{
    \caseofthree{\(\vt[_1], \vt[_2]\)}
                {\(\mathbf{clr}(a),\emptyset\) \\ \(\emptyset, \mathbf{clr}(a)\)}{\(\mathbf{clr}(a)\)}
                {\(\emptyset,\emptyset\)}{\(\emptyset\)}
                {\(\underline{~~}, \underline{~~}\)}{\(\fail\)}
  }
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Proving Safety with Sharing}

We need to axiomatize the fact that only the lax compartment is allowed to
do memory unsafe things.

\section{Trust While Using Unsafe Idioms}

While we have proven that our compartmentalization policy protects our rigid
compartment from lax ones, we conjecture that it can also protect a lax compartment
from an attacker that aims to exploit its non-standard behavior. But what does it mean
for a compartment to be protected when it contains UB? To demonstrate the difficulty,
consider the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
C >> f() {
  int x[10];
  x[10] = 42;
  return 5;
}
\end{verbatim}

Since {\tt f} writes out of bounds, its behavior is undefined, and under a full memory safety
policy it will always failstop---which in turn means that it will vacuously satisfy all safety
properties robustly. Under our compartmentalization policy, the write to {\tt x[10]} will either
be successful (but unstable) or it will failstop. If it doesn't failstop, {\tt f} returns 5,
which means that there are a large number of safety properties no satisfied. Clearly,
we cannot expect our policy to preserve arbitrary safety properties that are satisfied in
a memory safe setting.

Instead, we define a new partial memory model in which each compartment has its own private
(concrete) address space. The model is axiomatized such that, in each private address space,
in-bounds loads and stores behave as expected, while out-of-bounds accesses are unstable and
may failstop. This memory model forms the specification from which we derive a robust
safety preservation property.

\sna{After some consideration, I've come to the conclusion that this is the approach
  most likely to work. One con: this means I have to actually define that memory model
  (but I envision it being basically n Concrete C memories stacked on top of one another).}

%\section{Related Work}

%There is a whole bunch of work that deals with similar concepts that we need to
%distinguish ourselves from. This is fundamentally a compartmentalization paper,
%so we need to justify the novelty of our approach to compartments, and since we
%are making claims in the secure compilation space we need to show how we stack up there.

%\subsection{Comparing to Compartmentalization Schemes}

%The key points of comparison with other compartmentalization schemes are in whether they
%support sharing, and more broadly, how they divide up the program.

%\paragraph{Catalin's group and other ``no sharing'' schemes}

%The sharing of memory between compartments can be difficult to implement in many enforcement
%mechanism, and even when it is not, it may make proofs about the system more challenging.
%It is straightforward to implement in Tagged C. How hard it is for proofs remain to be seen.
%\sna{I am strongly opposed to removing sharing, I would rather ditch the proofs if I must.}

%We follow Catalin's group in separating programs into compartments by grouping functions,
%and giving each compartment access to its own data, including everything that it allocates.

%\paragraph{Mandatory Access Control}

%The alternative to grouping functions with their own data is Mandatory Access Control.
%In this setting, functions are ``subjects'' and other data are ``objects.'' A compartmentalization
%scheme comprises a table mapping subjects to the objects that they are allowed to access.
%The downside of this approach is that it can take a lot of effort to assign subjects and objects
%and write the table!

%\subsection{Comparing to Secure Compilation Work}

%We compare ourselves to the secure compilation literature in terms of our properties.
%The paper will have already gone into robust safety preservation, so we need to convince
%ourselves there the other relevant properties aren't suitable.

%\paragraph{Full Abstraction}

%For a long time, fully abstract compilation (preservation of observational equivalence) was
%the go-to property for secure compilation. The secure compilation world has moved away from
%it largely because it tends to be too strong. Observational equivalence being a hyperproperty,
%it is too strong for enforcement mechanisms that can only preserve safety properties.
%That means that it doesn't work for us, either.
%\sna{But I should still go into more detail about that.}

%\paragraph{Dynamic Compromise}

%We should compare our attacker model to the Dynamic Compromise of Abate et. al. In their model,
%a compromised component---one that has encountered UB during its run---is dynamically replaced
%by an arbitrary assembly program. This represents a very general view of UB: in the presence of UB,
%a compiler might produce any assembly whatsoever. By contrast, in the world of Tagged C,
%all memory-UB is given a reasonable concrete definition,
%so our model constrains the attacker to that definition. It is a strength of Concrete C that
%we are able to work in this simpler attacker model.
