 * @brief
 * Executive Summary:
 *   A "heap leak" can mean just about any problem with the heap, many of which are silent and/or
 *      nodestructive. This policy is concerned with 3 types of heap problems: overreads, 
 *      overwrites, and secret recovery from memory that has been correctly freed but not cleaned
 *      or overwritten so the secret can be recovered by the next legal owner. 
 *  This policy operates very similiarly to the one discussed in "Micro-Policies: Formally Verified, Tag-Based Security Monitors"
 *      https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163062 , with an additional feature of tagging memory that has been 
 * 
 * Problem: 
 *   A "heap leak" is very ambigous. There are at least 5 types, 3 of which this policy covers:
 *   (1) heap buffer overwrite (RCE)
 *   (2) heap buffer overread (heartbleed)
 *   (3) heap address leak (defeat ASLR in an exploit chain)
 *         EDIT: We are not covering this one in HeapProblem.v
 *         See HeapAddressSIF.v for this one. 
 *   (4) heap secret recovery from dirty memory (steal keys that were correctly
 *          freed but not overwritten before being reused)
 *   (5) heap resource exhaustion/resource leak through memory (DOS by OOM)
 *          We are not covering this case. It is a bad fit for tags
 * 
 * Current Solutions: 
 *   (1)(2) are things that SOTA fuzzers can reasonably detect when augmented with 
 *         sanitizers like ASAN. However they cannot usually tell (1) and (2) apart from
 *         each other or from other segfaulting conditions. 
 *         Santitizers are not always availabe either.
 *   (4) No fuzzer currently detects secret recovery from dirty heap memory as far as I know.
 * 
 * Related Work:
 *    - We will eagerly color memory. However, there is a lazy algorithm, based on the observation that
 *        memory is sometimes allocated in large chunks & never used. However, it is aimed at performance
 *        and this is aimed at diagnostic information to feed a fuzzer.
 *        See https://ic.ese.upenn.edu/pdf/stack_ieeesp2018.pdf 
 * 
 * 
 * Overall Policy Algorithm to detect heap problems (1),(2),(4):
 *  - Starting state:
 *      - PC counter is set to 0, nothing's been malloc'ed yet
 *      - heap mem is all set to L_UnallocatedHeap
 *      - stack mem et al. is set to L_NotHeap
 *      - data, globals, etc set to N  
 *      - The allocator is the concrete one. The intent is to
 *        emulate the real, nontagged system as closely as possible.
 *  - When memory is allocated via MallocT
 *      - the value tag on the pointer is colored with the location of the malloc and the current color from the pc tag
 *      - the location tags on the block are marked with the same location + color, marked AllocatedDirty (to detect Heap Problem #4)
 *      - color counter is increased
 *  - When memory is written via StoreT
 *      - If pt is not a pointer tag, error
 *      - If pt is a ptr tag, but the location+color does not match, that is heap problem #1 
 *      - If pt is a ptr tag and the location+color in the pointer match those of the block..
 *        - and if the tags on teh block are L_AllocatedWithColor, nothing happens. Program goes on its merry way
 *        - and if the tags on the block are L_AllocatedDirty, we swap them to L_AllocatedWithColor and rule 
 *            out Heap Problem #4. This should only happen on the first write. 
 *        - and if any of the tags are L_UnallocatedHeap, that's trying to overwrite heap you don't own,
 *             a heap problem #1! 
 *        - and if any of the tags are L_NotHeap, or N, there's a pointer corruption problem.
 *        - [debug] if any of the block tags are PC_Extra or pointers, that's most likely a policy bug
 *  - When memory is read via LoadT
 *      - If pt is not a pointer tag, error
 *      - Recurse on lts
 *        - If the block tag is allocated & match the location+color of the ptr, ok
 *        - If the block tag is allocated, but has the wrong color, that's a heap problem
 *        - If the block tag is N, error. pointer might be corrupted
 *        - If the block tag is L_AllocatedDirty, then its reading memory it shouldn't. 
 *            Then it's possible to have heap problem #4
 *            Log it, and let it continue. The fuzzer will decide if a secret was recovered this way.
 *        - If the block tag is L_NotHeap, L_UnallocatedHeap, that is heap problem #2 (overread)
 *        - [debug] if the tag's PC or pointer, then there is a policy error
 *  - When memory is freed via FreeT
 *      - If the pt is not a pointer tag, auto fail. 
 *      - If the header tag is N, L_NotHeap, or L_UnallocatedHeap, fail
 *      - If the header tag is AllocatedDirty, or AllocatedwithColor and the location+color are the same, success
 *      - If the header tag is Allocated, but the location+color do not match, 
 *  - Binary Operations & Unary Operations
 *      - most of the unary ones don't make a lot of sense with pointers 
 *      - classic arthimetic ops that make sense with ptrs preserve pointerness
 *      - bitwise operations preserve pointerness 
 *      - comparisons with pointers are UB unless the color matches.
 *          We will allow the pointerness to propagate, but will log
 *          the suspicious operation.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *  - colors (Z) is infinite.
 *  - running in a relatively trustworthy test environment (for fuzzing most likely) 
 *  - Needs the concrete allocator to emulate a realistic malloc that does not zero memory
 *  - Implements Policy Interface.
 * 
 * TaggedC Interpreter Notes:
 *  - in this version of PIPE there is a tag on the value and one on byte memory. 
 *  - This is an abstraction of spliting them up to make reasoning easier. 
 *       In hardware it is all together.
 *  - For example on an int: 
 *    - 1 tag on int value
 *    - 4 location tags, one per byte.
 *  - Can be used to catch misaligned loads and stores, in theory.
 * 
 * Future Work (?):
 *  - HeapAddressSIF.v 
 *  - @TODO there are some questions throughout
 *  - @TODO test that the failures have _enough_ information, but not too much
 *  - @TODO heap tests are not hooked into run all tests.py
 *  - @TODO alter concrete allocator to not clear memory
 *  - @WAITING - Sean is working on logging, which should emit the bytes not the tags.
 *      - We need it for improper secret disclosure. 
 *      - Hack up whatever kinda works, and may also support different ways of initing bytes,
 *         then try to exatract a more principled approach later

    MallocT uses the current counter to color the allocation, marking it as belonging to color currcolor.
      It colors the value tag on the pointer, the header tag on the block, and the tags on the block itself.
      It updates pct's color counter by 1. 

    Note: 
      - vtb is not used by us, so it's set to N.
      - MallocT should be the only thing manipulating the colorcounter. We're assuming infinite fresh,
          monotonically increasing counters.
  
    Arguments
      - pct is program counter tag
      - fptrt is the tag on the function pointer that is being called, often left defT
          In a world with multiple mallocs (like compartments) this is useful.
      - st is the tag on the size, we don't use it 
    
      In the return tuple
      - pct' new program counter tag, counter increased
      - pt new tag on the pointer returned from malloc, colored.
      - vtb - vt body - tag on values written, 00s usually. These won't tell you if something is alloc
      - vth - vt header - tag on "header" or index -1, above what pointer points to 
      - lt new location (in memory) tag, this now painted as allocated memory across
           whole region. Even though it's 1 tag, it affects all tags in the buffer.
           Free in this policy does not look at these at all, so it does not really
           matter was value goes here.

  FreeT 
      If the memory pointed to by the pointer has the same color as the pointer, it is freed and
        set to unallocated heap. If the user tries to free a nonpointer header, something not in the heap,
        or unallocated heap it will fail. If they try to free mismatched colors it will fail. 

  Note: 
      While we take the pointer tag as a parameter, it is not outputted by the rule, so we can't clear it.
      This matches the behavior in hte micropolicy paper 
  
  Args:
    pct - program counter tag, which has the current Freecolor (acquired in LabelT)
    fptrt - tag on the function pointer of this fn (useful in world with multiple frees)
    pt - pointer tag of pointer to block (tag on the argument passed to free() )
    vth value tag on header, vt header, of block to free
  
  If rule succeeds, the return tuple contains:
    1st tag - pct, program counter tag
    2nd tag - vt body, tags on body of valyes in block
    3rd tag - vt header tag on the header, index -1 of block. This carries the free color.
    4th tag - lt, location tags in block 
  
  If rule fails, the return tuple's most important members are:
    - vht is the color of previous free
    - pct is the color of the 2nd/current free
