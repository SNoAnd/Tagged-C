        - the concreteC one doesnt clear, but the 
    - how do we do +/- 50 bytes on a location? some ad hackery will be needed 
        start with just that chunk, than give me the +/- later?
        hack up whatever kinda works, and may also support different ways of initing bytes,
          then try to exatract a more principled approach later 
          dump the entire memory & have the fuzzer rifle through
          can we know what the offset into it was?

    problems: the dynamic tag ? sif already existing?
    algorithm:
        overread/overwrite #1, #2
          at start, mark everything unallocated
          in malloc, grab l:loc, compute a dynamic # ?, tag each byte with l from u, unallocated. tag the ptr with its l
          in load/read check that it matches the pointer's l
          in free, clear tag on mem bytes
              Should it clear the one on the pointer?
              how does this work with malloc struct of ptrs and filling it
        
              put the color of the nested on the value tag and the byte tag of the allocated

            "state goes in the pc tag", so the counter goes there? 

        secrets left in buffer after freeing #4
          if we can id the secrets, maybe with labelT, special tag type on it?
            AllocatedSecret(l:loc) ? then when it frees convert it to 
            UnAllocatedSecret(l:loc) until its written over?

            failstop & out 

        heap address leak, #3

 * "heap leak" can mean just about any problem with the heap. There are at least 5:
 *      (1) heap buffer overwrite (RCE)
 *      (2) heap buffer overread (heartbleed)
 *      (3) heap address leak (defeat ASLR in an exploit chain)
            EDIT: we are ignoring for this one 
 *      (4) heap secret recovery from improper clean up (steal keys that were correctly
 *              freed but not zeroed out)
 *      (5) heap resource exhaustion/resource leak through memory (DOS by OOM)
 *          We are not including this one. 
 * 
 *      (1)(2) are things that SOTA fuzzers can reasonably detect when augmented with 
 *          sanitizers like ASAN. 
 *      However they cannot usually tell (1) and (2) apart from each other or other segfaulting
 *          conditions. 

Basic Features:
  - Implements Policy Interface.

Future Work (?):

Assumptions:

TaggedC Interpreter Notes:
  - in this version of PIPE there is a tag on the value and one on byte memory. 
    This is an abstraction of spliting them up to make reasoning easier. 
    In hardware it is all together.
    For example on an int: 
      1 tag on int value
      4 location tags, one per byte.
      Can be used to catch misaligned loads and stores, in theory.
